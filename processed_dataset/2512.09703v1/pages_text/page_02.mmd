###### Theorem A (Theorem 3.3).

Let (W,P) be minuscule, and \mu\in\operatorname{Dr}(W,P) be a point in the corresponding Coxeter Dressian. Then \mu induces a subdivision of its matroid polytope into strong Coxeter matroid polytopes.

Theorem A holds for all Lie types admitting minuscule matroids. That is, for types A,B,C,D,E\_{6},E\_{7}. We show that, in previously unknown cases for types D and E\_{6}, the converse holds. We give a counter example to the converse for type B. For E\_{7}, we show that a proper subset of the strong exchange equations is sufficient to detect strong matroidal subdivisions.

Simplifying systems equations can be crucial for explicit computations. In the A\_{n} case, it is well-known that the 3-term Grassmann–Plücker relations imply the other relations [10, 18]. A similar statement is known in the type D\_{n} [16]. We prove the type B\_{n} analog.

###### Theorem B (Theorem 4.9).

Let \mu\in\mathbb{T}^{2^{[n]}}, such that \operatorname{supp}(\mu) is a strong Coxeter matroid of type B\_{n}. Then \mu belongs to the Coxeter Dressian if and only if \mu satisfies the *4-term strong exchange equations*.

As the strong exchange equations reflect the structure of the associated Coxeter matroid polytopes, it is natural to study Coxeter Dressians and valuations via direct computation. Using OSCAR [14], we implement code to compute the polytopes and equations, test if a height function is contained in the Coxeter Dressian, and determine if a subdivision is Coxeter matroidal. We directly compute special cases of Coxeter Dressians in type B\_{n} for n\in\{3,4\}, and type D\_{n} for n\in\{5,6\}. Furthermore, we compare these prevarieties to the secondary fans of the relevant polytopes, and compute the f-vectors. Finally, we perform an exhaustive computation to verify that strong exchange holds for all E\_{7} minuscule Coxeter matroids. Our computations can be found at the following github repository:

For this extended abstract, we assume some knowledge of regular subdivisions and secondary fans. The standard reference is [9]. For all aspects of tropical geometry, we point to [12, 13]. Our reference for (Coxeter) matroid theory is [3].

## 2. Coxeter Matroids and their polytopes

We defer to Chapter 5 of [3] for the formal definitions concerning (classifications of) root systems, reflection groups, and general cryptomorphisms for Coxeter matroids. However, we remind the reader that *root system* are special collections of vectors corresponding to mirrors over hyperplanes in \mathbb{R}^{n} with deep connections to representation theory. Any root system \Phi gives rise to a *Weyl group* W, acting on Euclidean space as a finite reflection group. Any choice of *simple roots* \Phi^{s}=\{s\_{1},\dots,s\_{n}\} then yields generators of W, i.e., W=\langle s\_{1},\dots,s\_{n}\rangle. When we refer to a Weyl group, we implicitly assume the datum of its root system is known.
Finally, every irreducible root system is uniquely classified by type A\_{n},B\_{n},C\_{n},\dots (etc). So when we say (for example) W=W(B\_{n}), we mean that W is a reflection group associated with the type B\_{n} root system, and that W is generated by n simple reflections within \Phi^{s}.

Now, let W=\langle s\_{1},\dots,s\_{n}\mid s\_{i}\in\Phi^{s}\rangle, and consider P=\langle s\_{i\_{1}},\dots,s\_{i\_{k}}\rangle. Let v\in V\setminus\{0\} be such that \operatorname{stab}\_{W}(v)=P. That is, \sigma\cdot v=v if and only if \sigma\in P. Then we identify every element of the orbit W\cdot v with a unique coset in W/P. For any \mathcal{M}\subseteq W/P, we generate the polytope

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Delta(\mathcal{M})=\mathrm{conv}(\{\sigma\cdot v\mid\sigma P\in\mathcal{M}\}). |  |

The vertices of \Delta(W/P) are identified with the cosets, and every edge of \Delta(W/P) is parallel to an element of \Phi. More generally, \mathcal{M}\subseteq W/P is a *Coxeter matroid* if every edge of \Delta(\mathcal{M}) is p
