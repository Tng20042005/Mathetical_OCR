Let \mu:2^{[n]}\to\mathbb{T} be arbitrary, and \varphi:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R} be affine linear. We consider the variables as vertices of the n-cube Q\_{n}=[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]^{n}. We fix I,J\subseteq[n] with |I\triangle J|\geq 3. For each monomial x\_{I\triangle i}\odot x\_{J\triangle i} in f^{B}\_{I,J}, evaluating at \mu+\varphi|\_{V(Q\_{n})} yields \mu\_{I\setminus i}+\mu\_{J\cup i}+(\varphi(e\_{I})+\varphi(e\_{J})-\varphi(0)), the last term being independent of i. The same holds for x\_{I}\odot x\_{J}, in the case |I\triangle J|\equiv 1\mod 2. Thus \mu attains the minimum at least twice if and only if \mu+\varphi|\_{V(\Delta(r,n))} does.
  ∎

It is now natural to ask, whether type B\_{n} behaves as nicely as type A\_{n}, and the converse of Theorem 3.4 also holds. This turns out to be wrong already for n=3, as the following example shows.

###### Example 4.2.

We get a single strong exchange equation in type B\_{3}, which is supported on the entire 3-cube and given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f^{B}\_{\emptyset,[3]}=x\_{\emptyset}\odot x\_{123}\oplus x\_{1}\odot x\_{23}\oplus x% \_{2}\odot x\_{13}\oplus x\_{3}\odot x\_{12}. |  |

Some functions on the 3-cube induce strong matroidal subdivisions, but are not in the Coxeter Dressian. One such example is:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (\mu\_{\emptyset},\mu\_{1},\mu\_{2},\mu\_{3},\mu\_{12},\mu\_{13},\mu\_{23},\mu\_{123})% =(0,0,0,-1,2,1,1,0)\,. |  |

There are 5 maximal cells in the induced subdivision, each of which are tetrahedra. Notice that none of these cells contain any antipodes. We visualize the subdivision in Figure 1. However, by direct computation, we observe that there *is* an element of \operatorname{Dr}(B\_{3},P\_{3}) that induces this subdivision.

###### Lemma 4.3.

Let \mu\in\mathbb{R}^{2^{[n]}} satisfy the all strong exchange equations supported on the 3-dimensional faces of the 4-cube. Then \mu is already a strong valuated Coxeter matroid.

### 4.3. Type C\_{n}

The only minuscule parabolic of type C is P\_{1}. Cosets wP\_{1}\in W(C\_{n})/P\_{1} are identified with [n]\sqcup-[n] via wP\_{1}\mapsto w(1). Hence, the polytope associated to (C\_{n},P\_{1}) is given by the *cross polytope*

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Diamond\_{n}=\mathrm{conv}(\pm e\_{i}:i\in[n]). |  |

All pairs (\pm e\_{i},\pm e\_{j}) for i\neq j form edges on \Diamond\_{n}. On the other hand, 2e\_{i} is an element of the type C\_{n} root system. In other words, all possible subpolytopes of \Diamond\_{n} are strong matroids, and all subdivisions of \Diamond\_{n} are strong matroidal. In particular, there are no strong exchange type C\_{n} equations, and the Coxeter Dressian \operatorname{Dr}(C\_{n},P\_{1}) is exactly the secondary fan of \Diamond\_{n}.

### 4.4. Type D\_{n}

Recall that in type D\_{n}, the Weyl group is the intersection of the alternating group with the hyperoctahedral group. There are three minuscule parabolic subgroups P\_{1},P\_{n-1}, and P\_{n}. Note that the last two are isomorphic as subgroups of D\_{n}, and they were studied in [16].
