#### 4.4.1. Minuscule Parabolic P\_{1} in type D

Note that W(D\_{n})/P\_{1}\cong W(C\_{n})/P\_{1}, hence the polytope that arises in this situation is again the cross-polytope \Diamond\_{n} of Section 4.3. However, 2e\_{i} is not an element of the D\_{n} root system, so the segment connecting e\_{i},-e\_{i} is not an admissible edge of a type D\_{n} matroidal subdivision of \Diamond\_{n}. It follows in a straightforward way that any subdivision of \Diamond\_{n} that is not a triangulation is strong matroidal. The singular strong exchange equation defining \operatorname{Dr}(D\_{n},P\_{1}) is of the form:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4) |  | \displaystyle f^{D}\_{\Diamond\_{n}}=\bigoplus^{n}\_{i=1}x\_{i}\odot x\_{-i}\,. |  |

###### Proposition 4.4.

The type D\_{n} strong exchange equation 4 is affinely invariant.

* Proof.

  Consider f^{E\_{7}}, and \mu\in\mathbb{T}^{V(\Diamond\_{n})}. For \varphi:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R} affine linear, we have that x\_{i}\odot x\_{-i} evaluated at \mu+\varphi|\_{V(\Diamond\_{n})} yields \mu\_{i}+\mu\_{-i}+2\varphi(0). Therefore, \mu attains the minimum at least twice if and only if \mu+\varphi does.
  ∎

###### Proposition 4.5.

A height function \mu induces a type D strong matroidal subdivision of \Diamond\_{n} if and only if \mu\in\operatorname{Dr}(D\_{n},P\_{1}).

* Proof.

  One direction follows immediately from Proposition 4.4. For the other, suppose the \mu induced subdivision is strong matroidal, and let \Delta(\mathcal{M}) be a maximal cell. Then \Delta(\mathcal{M})=C\_{v},

  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  |  | C\_{v}=\mathrm{conv}(e\_{i}:\langle v,e\_{i}\rangle)+\mu\_{i}\leq\langle v,e\_{k}% \rangle+\mu\_{k}\text{ where }i,k\in[n]\cup[-n]). |  |

  Now, observe that for C\_{v} to be full dimensional, C\_{v} must use at least n+1 vertices of \Diamond\_{n}. As a consequence, we must have some some i\in[n] where e\_{i},e\_{-i}\in C\_{v}. Furthermore, since \Delta(\mathcal{M})=C\_{v} is a strong matroid, we have at least one j such that e\_{j},e\_{-j}\in C\_{v}. This leads to the following collection of relations:

  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  |  | \displaystyle\langle v,e\_{\pm i}\rangle+\mu\_{\pm i}=\langle v,e\_{\pm j}\rangle% +\mu\_{\pm j}\leq\langle v,e\_{\pm k}\rangle+\mu\_{\pm k}\text{ for any }k\in[n]. |  |

  From these, one can deduce \mu\_{i}+\mu\_{-i}=\mu\_{j}+\mu\_{-j}\leq\mu\_{k}+\mu\_{-k}\text{ for any $k$}.
  ∎

###### Proposition 4.6.

For n\in\{5,6\}, the Coxeter Dressian \operatorname{Dr}(D\_{n},P\_{1}) is isomorphic to a proper subfan of the secondary fan of \Diamond\_{n}. That is, the coarsest polyhedral structure of the former agrees with the fan structure of the latter, the Coxeter Dressian.

* Proof.

  We verify this computationally. See the related notebook on the github repository.
  ∎

It follows from Proposition 4.6, and the fact that any subdivision of \Diamond\_{n} which isn’t a triangulation is strong matroidal, that \operatorname{Dr}(D\_{n},P\_{1}) is isomorphic to the subfan of the secondary fan consisting of codimension-1 cones.

#### 4.4.2. Minuscule Parabolic P\_{n}

We identify cosets A\in W(D\_{n})/P\_{n} with even subsets of {[n]} via A\mapsto A(-[n])\cap[n]. In analogy to the B\_{n} case, the corresponding polytope is the *demicube*, the subpolytope of the cube with even vertices. We note that the parabolics P\_{n-1} and P\_{n} are isomorphic as subgroups of W(D\_{n}), hence we only consider the latter case. The strong exchange equations are given by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5) |  | \displaystyle f\_{I,J}^{D}\coloneqq\bigoplus\_{i\in I\triangle J}x\_{I\triangle i% }\odot x\_{J\triangle i} |  |

for I,J\subseteq[n] with |I\triangle J|\geq 4 and I,J of odd cardinality. Affine invariance follows exactly like in 4.1.
There is a simple construction relating valuated strong Coxeter matroids of type B\_{n} to those of type D\_{n+1}, with minuscule parabolic P\_{n+1}.
