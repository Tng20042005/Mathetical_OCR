###### Abstract.

In this extended abstract, we study special tropical prevarieties which we call Coxeter Dressians. They arise from equations capturing a generalization of valuated symmetric basis exchange for Coxeter matroids. In particular, we study subdivisions of the associated Coxeter matroid polytopes. We show that the subdivisions induced by points of the Coxeter Dressian consist of cells which are strong Coxeter matroidal. This generalizes well-known results in type A to other Lie types. Finally, we implement explicit computations of Coxeter Dressians in OSCAR.

## 1. Introduction

Tropicalization is a process that famously translates algebro-geometric objects into combinatorial ones. Importantly, it is sensitive to chosen coordinates and embeddings of given varieties. Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous throughout the disciplines of algebra, geometry, and adjacent fields. In this project, we are interested in tropicalizing so-called *strong exchange equations*, which appear naturally in representation theory. The spaces they cut out are known as *generalized flag varieties*.

One such instance is the Grassmann–Plücker equations. It is well-known, that these equations cut out the Grassmannian, which parametrizes subspaces of a given vector space. Its tropical counterpart, the Dressian, parametrizes tropical linear spaces, and is obtained by explicitly tropicalizing the equations. The study of tropical linear spaces, going back to [18], has been proven to be one of the most fruitful endeavors in tropical geometry, with numerous connections to combinatorics, algebra, and biology.

When one studies tropical linear spaces, or valuated matroids, in the background of the theory one always finds the root system A\_{n}. An example is the Gel’fand–Serganova theorem, or Speyer’s characterization of valuated matroids [18] of valuations inducing matroidal subdivision of the hypersimplex. The goal of this paper is to go beyond the type A\_{n} case, and introduce valuated matroids as well as Dressians for different root systems.

Coxeter matroids are generalizations of matroids which arise as collections of cosets in W/P, where W is a reflection group of any Lie type, and P is a standard parabolic subgroup. We study Coxeter matroids which possess the *strong exchange property*, which captures the symmetric exchange property of usual matroids. We further restrict to a special subclass, those Coxeter matroids which are said to be *minuscule*. Minuscule strong exchange Coxeter matroids are the most faithful incarnation of usual matroids outside Lie type A.

For us, the relevant tropical prevarieties are defined by the equations which recently appeared in [6]. We call the prevarieties of interest *Coxeter Dressians*.
Let \mathbb{T}\coloneqq\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\} be the semifield of tropical numbers with \min-notation. For minuscule W/P, the Coxeter Dressian is denoted \operatorname{Dr}(W,P)\subseteq\mathbb{T}^{W/P}. For each W/P, these defining equations are obtained by tropicalizing polynomials which generate the ideal of the related generalized flag variety [6]. When feasible, we compute and study concrete examples of these prevarieties. Every Coxeter matroid admits an encoding as a polytope. We study the tropical geometry associated with regular polyhedral subdivisions into cells which are again Coxeter matroidal. Our main theorem is as follows.
