Let E\subset\mathbb{R}^{n} be finite, and \mu\colon E\to\mathbb{T}, with induced subdivision S(\mu) of \mathrm{conv}(\operatorname{supp}(\mu)). Let \mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathbb{T}[x\_{e}|e\in E] be an affinely invariant set of tropical polynomials with trivial coefficients. If \mu\in V^{\operatorname{trop}}(\mathcal{F})\subseteq\mathbb{T}^{E}, then for any cell C\in S(\mu), the function

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\mu\_{C}\colon E\to\mathbb{T},\quad e\mapsto\begin{cases}% \hidden@noalign{}\textstyle 0\ \ \ \text{ if }e\in C\\ \hidden@noalign{}\textstyle\infty\,\text{ else}\end{cases} |  |

satisfies all tropical equations in \mathcal{F}. In other words, \mu\_{C}\in V^{\operatorname{trop}}(\mathcal{F)}.

* Proof.

  Consider a cell C of S(\mu). Let \tilde{\mu}=\mu+\varphi for some affine linear function \varphi such that \tilde{\mu}|\_{C}=0 and \tilde{\mu}|\_{S\setminus C}>0.
  Since \mathcal{F} is affinely invariant, \tilde{\mu}\in V^{\operatorname{trop}}(\mathcal{F}). Since \mu,\tilde{\mu} only differ by an affine linear function, their induced subdivisions agree.
  Let f\in\mathcal{F}, then f=\bigoplus\_{\alpha}x^{\odot\alpha} for finitely many \alpha\in\mathbb{N}^{E}. Since this minimum is attained at least twice, when plugging in \tilde{\mu}, there are two cases:

  + –

    If the evaluation f(\tilde{\mu})=0, then there are at least two monomials of f supported on C. In that case, surely f(\mu\_{C}) = 0, and the minimum is attained at these monomials. Thus, \mu\_{C}\in V^{\operatorname{trop}}(f).
  + –

    If f(\tilde{\mu})>0, then all monomials of f contain a variable in E\setminus C. It follows, that f(\mu\_{C})=\infty, and hence trivially \mu\_{C} tropically satisfies f.

  ∎

###### Theorem 3.4.

For all minuscule types A\_{n},B\_{n},C\_{n},D\_{n},E\_{6},E\_{7}, the set of strong exchange equations are affinely invariant. Thus, by Theorem 3.3, all height functions V(\Delta(W/P))\to\mathbb{T} satisfying the respective equations induce strong matroidal subdivisions.

* Proof.

  We prove affine invariance case by case in Section 4. More specifically, we deal with cases where valuations are not already well studied. We do so via Propositions 4.1 (type (B\_{n},P\_{n})), 4.4 (type (D\_{n},P\_{1})), 4.12 (type (E\_{7},P\_{1})). Proofs for the other cases can be done in a similar fashion, but are omitted here. From affine invariance, the indicator vectors of the cells satisfy respective strong exchange equations, hence by [6, Theorem 1.1], the cells are strong matroid polytopes.

## 4. The Minuscule Types

In this section we will explicitly look at tropical strong exchange equations individually for each minuscule Lie type. These equations were systematically analyzed in [6] over the Boolean semifield.

### 4.1. Type A\_{n}

As mentioned in the introduction, valuations of type A Coxeter matroids have been extensively studied even outside the minuscule case [18, 5, 11]. For the equations corresponding to usual matroids, we defer to [13, Chapter 4]. The type A strong exchange equations are exactly the Grassmann–Plücker equations. They are affinely invariant, but we will omit a proof in this abstract.

### 4.2. Type B\_{n}

Recall that in type B\_{n}, the Weyl group is the hyperoctahedral group, and the only minuscule parabolic subgroup is P\_{n}=\langle s\_{1},\dots,s\_{n-1}\rangle=\operatorname{stab}\_{B\_{n}}(-[n]). We identify cosets wP\_{n}\in B\_{n}/P\_{n} with subsets of {[n]} via wP\_{n}\mapsto w(-[n])\cap[n]. Fixing (B\_{n},P\_{n}), the *strong exchange equations* are

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3) |  | \displaystyle f\_{I,J}^{B}\coloneqq\begin{cases}\hidden@noalign{}\textstyle% \bigoplus\_{i\in I\triangle J}x\_{I\triangle i}\odot x\_{J\triangle i}\hskip 56.0% 51929pt\text{ if }|I\triangle J|\equiv 0\mod 2\\ \hidden@noalign{}\textstyle x\_{I}\odot x\_{J}\oplus\bigoplus\_{i\in I\triangle J% }x\_{I\triangle i}\odot x\_{J\triangle i}\quad\text{ if }|I\triangle J|\equiv 1% \mod 2,\end{cases} |  |

for all I,J\subseteq[n] with |I\triangle J|\geq 3.
They are tropicalizations of quadratic algebraic equations cutting out the type B\_{n} minuscule flag variety.

###### Proposition 4.1.

The type B\_{n} strong exchange equations 3 are affinely invariant.
