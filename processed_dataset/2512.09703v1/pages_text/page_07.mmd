induces a linear isomorphism \operatorname{Dr}(B\_{n},P\_{n})\cong\operatorname{Dr}(D\_{n+1},P\_{n+1}).

* Proof.

  We first show that type B\_{n} strong exchange equations are in bijection to type D\_{n+1} strong exchange equations via f\_{I,J}^{B}\mapsto f\_{I^{\prime},J^{\prime}}^{D}. Here I^{\prime}=I\cup\{n+1\} if |I| even, and I^{\prime}=I if |I| odd, similarly, J^{\prime}. Bijectivity follows from the fact that I^{\prime}, J^{\prime} are always of odd cardinality, and |I\triangle J|\geq 3 if and only if |I^{\prime}\triangle J^{\prime}|\geq 4.

  Let \mu\in\operatorname{Dr}(B\_{n},P\_{n}), and \overline{\mu}\in\mathbb{T}^{2^{[n+1]}} its corresponding image. We now show that \mu satisfies f\_{I,J}^{B} if and only if \overline{\mu} satisfies f\_{I^{\prime},J^{\prime}}^{D}. If both I,J are of odd cardinality, then the respective equations are the same, and there is nothing to show. If I is odd, and J is even, then I^{\prime}=I, and J^{\prime}=J\cup\{n+1\}. In that case, I^{\prime}\triangle J^{\prime}=I\triangle J\cup\{n+1\} is of odd cardinality. Hence, for all i\in I\triangle J, we have I\triangle\{i\} is even, and \overline{J\triangle i}=J^{\prime}\triangle i. Finally, for i=\{n+1\}, we have I\triangle i=I, and J=J^{\prime}\triangle i, finishing the proof for the case |I| even, |J| odd. Lastly, let I,J both be even. Then I\triangle J=I^{\prime}\triangle J^{\prime}, and for all i\in I\triangle J we have \overline{I\triangle i}=I^{\prime}\triangle i, finishing the proof.
  ∎

We note that the above is already true algebraically, as the same morphism over any field maps the minuscule type B\_{n} flag variety isomorphically onto the even component of the spinor variety. There is also an equivalent map \operatorname{Dr}(B\_{n},P\_{n})\cong\operatorname{Dr}(D\_{n+1},P\_{n}), mapping subsets of [n] to odd subsets of [n+1]. As the even and odd components of the spinor variety are isomorphic, this is not surprising. The following can be deduced immediately from Proposition 4.7 and [16, Theorem 4.6].

###### Corollary 4.8.

For n\leq 4, the Coxeter Dressian \operatorname{Dr}(B\_{n},P\_{n}) is the tropicalization of the minuscule type B\_{n} flag variety. For n\geq 6, it is strictly larger than the tropicalization. In particular, not every valuated Coxeter matroid of type B\_{n} is realizable for n\geq 6.

###### Theorem 4.9.

Let \mu\in\mathbb{T}^{2^{[n]}}, such that \operatorname{supp}(\mu) is a strong Coxeter matroid of type B\_{n} . Then the following statements are equivalent:

1. (a)

   \mu is in the Coxeter Dressian,
2. (b)

   \mu satisfies the *four term strong exchange equations* f\_{I,J}^{B} for |I\triangle J|\leq 4.

Moreover, if all entries of \mu are finite, in (b) it suffices to only consider the case |I\triangle J|\leq 3.

* Proof.

  The statement (a) \Rightarrow (b) holds by definition. For the other direction, we need to show that \mu satisfies all strong exchange equations f^{B}\_{I,J}. Consider the image \overline{\mu} from Proposition 4.7. By [16, Theorem 5.1], \overline{\mu} satisfies the type D\_{n+1} strong exchange equations if and only if it satisfies the respective four-term strong exchange equations. Hence \overline{\mu}\in\operatorname{Dr}(D\_{n+1},P\_{n+1}), and we conclude \mu\in\operatorname{Dr}(B\_{n},P\_{n}).

  Let additionally all entries of \mu be finite. Restricting \mu to the various 4-cubes and applying Lemma 4.3 we obtain that \mu satisfies all equations f\_{I,J}^{B} with |I\triangle J|=4 if it does so for all |I\triangle J|=3.
  ∎

###### Example 4.10.

The point \mu\in\mathbb{T}^{2^{[4]}} given by \mu\_{\emptyset}=\mu\_{1234}=\mu\_{12}=0, \mu\_{34}=1, and \mu\_{A}=\infty for all other A\in 2^{[n]} does not satisfy f^{B}\_{1,234}. Hence, it is not in the Coxeter Dressian However, it satisfies all equations supported on proper 3-faces of the 4-cube.

### 4.5. Type E\_{6}

In type E\_{6}, the two minuscule parabolic subgroups are P\_{1} and P\_{6}. Since P\_{1}\cong P\_{6}\cong W(D\_{5}), we have W(E\_{6})/P\_{1}\cong W(E\_{6})/P\_{6} as sets with W-action. We thus consider both cases simultaneously. The polytope is commonly referred to as 2\_{21}=\Delta(E\_{6}/P\_{1}) [7]. The face structure of 2\_{21} is studied in [8]. We recall the relevant facts. The polytope 2\_{21} is 6 dimensional and has 27 vertices, each at most edge-distance 2 from each other. Each distance 2 pair of vertices defines a \Diamond\_{5} cross polytope in the 5-skeleton of 2\_{21}, of which there are 27. All other facets are simplices. For each distance-2 pair (A,B), we get a strong exchange equation

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (6) |  | \displaystyle f^{E\_{6}}\_{A,B}=x\_{A}\odot x\_{B}\oplus\bigoplus^{4}\_{i=1}x\_{C\_{i% }}\odot x\_{C^{\prime}\_{i}}, |  |

where the pairs (A,B) and (C\_{i},C^{\prime}\_{i}) for i\in[4] are antipodes of the corresponding cross polytope. All strong exchange equations for minuscule E\_{6} arise in this way. By Proposition 4.4, the respective equations are affinely invariant.
