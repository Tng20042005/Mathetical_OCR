The proof of Wang (2025) is based on a clever and non-trivial application of optimal transport duality. The key idea is to express the worst-case expectation of a merging function over all dependence structures as the solution of a dual optimization problem involving separable dominating functions. This reduction effectively decouples the coordinates. The problem is then reduced to a one-dimensional bound, which is handled using a sharp characterization of admissible one-dimensional e-merging functions. While the final result is simple, the proof requires several auxiliary intermediate results and a delicate minimax argument.

Here we present a much simpler proof for the characterisation of e-merging functions. The key idea is to consider the concave envelope of F and use a classical hyperplane separation argument to show that it is dominated by a suitable affine function. Unlike the approach of Wang (2025), this proof does not rely on the monotonicity assumption in the definition of an e-merging function.222A key technical step in the proof of Wang (2025) is that the analysis can be restricted to upper semi-continuous e-merging functions. This reduction relies on a lemma from Vovk and Wang (2021), which shows that every (monotone) e-merging function is dominated by an upper semi-continuous e-merging function. To prove this result, Vovk and Wang (2021) crucially exploited the monotonicity assumption. For this reason, we formulate the result in a slightly more general setting. Specifically, we call a *generalised* e-merging function any Borel measurable mapping F:[0,\infty)^{K}\to[0,\infty) such that F\circ\mathbf{E} is an e-variable for every K-tuple \mathbf{E} of e-variables.

###### Theorem 1.

Let K\geq 1 be an integer and F:[0,\infty)^{K}\to[0,\infty) a generalised e-merging function. Then, there is a K-tuple \mathbf{w}\in[0,1]^{K} such that \sum\_{k=1}^{K}w\_{k}\leq 1 and, for every \mathbf{u}\in[0,\infty)^{K},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F(\mathbf{u})\leq 1+\sum\_{k=1}^{K}w\_{k}(u\_{k}-1)\,. |  |

We remark that the monotonicity requirement in the definition of e-merging functions is nevertheless natural from a statistical perspective: larger e-values correspond to stronger evidence against the null, and one would therefore expect this ordering to be preserved under merging. However 1 shows that this restriction is not essential at a mathematical level: any generalised e-merging function is always dominated by a (monotone) e-merging function. In this sense, allowing for non-monotonicity does not enlarge the effective class of admissible merging procedures, and there is therefore effectively no gain in extending the definition beyond the monotone case.

###### Corollary 1.

Let K\geq 1 be an integer and F:[0,\infty)^{K}\to[0,\infty) Borel-measurable. Then, F is a generalised e-merging function if, and only if, there is a K-tuple \mathbf{w}\in[0,1]^{K} such that \sum\_{k=1}^{K}w\_{k}\leq 1 and, for every \mathbf{u}\in[0,\infty)^{K},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F(\mathbf{u})\leq 1+\sum\_{k=1}^{K}w\_{k}(u\_{k}-1)\,. |  |

In particular, every generalised e-merging function is dominated by a (monotone) e-merging function.

###### Proof.

Fix a \mathbf{w} as in the statement, and let F\_{\mathbf{w}}:u\mapsto 1+\sum\_{k=1}^{K}w\_{k}(u\_{k}-1). It is straightforward to check that this is a (non-decreasing) e-merging function. Then, any Borel F:[0,\infty)^{K}\to[0,\infty) dominated by F\_{\mathbf{w}} is clearly a generalised e-merging function. The other direction is precisely 1.

## Geometric proof of the characterisation

The idea to prove 1 is rather simple. We consider the concave envelope \hat{F} of the generalised e-merging function F and we show that \hat{F}(\mathbf{1}{})\leq 1, where \mathbf{1}{} denotes the vector
(1,\dots,1)\in\mathbb{R}^{K}. Then, the supporting hyperplane theorem will immediately yield the desired conclusion.

First, let us establish a simple preliminary lemma, which will be the key ingredient of our proof.

###### Lemma 1.

Fix an integer n\geq 1, consider n vectors \mathbf{u}^{(1)},\dots,\mathbf{u}^{(n)}\in[0,\infty)^{K}, and a weight vector (q\_{1},\dots,q\_{n})\in[0,1]^{n}, such that \sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}=1. We have the following implication:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}\mathbf{u}^{(j)}=\mathbf{1}\qquad\implies\qquad\sum\_{j=1}^{% n}q\_{j}F(\mathbf{u}^{(j)})\leq 1\,. |  |

###### Proof.

Let \mathcal{X}=\{x\_{1},\dots,x\_{n}\} be a set made of n distinct elements, and consider the hypothesis \mathcal{H}=\{Q\} on \mathcal{X}, with Q=\sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}\delta\_{x\_{j}}. Define K random variables E\_{1},\dots,E\_{K} on \mathcal{X} via E\_{k}(x\_{j})=u^{(j)}\_{k}. Then,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{E}\_{Q}[E\_{k}]=\sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}E\_{k}(x\_{j})=\sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}u^{(j% )}\_{k}=1\,, |  |

and so each E\_{k} is an e-variable for \mathcal{H}. We have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}F\big{(}\mathbf{u}^{(j)}\big{)}=\sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}F\big{(}% E\_{1}(x\_{j}),\dots,E\_{K}(x\_{j})\big{)}=\mathbb{E}\_{Q}[F(E\_{1},\dots,E\_{K})]% \leq 1\,, |  |

since F being a generalised e-merging function implies that F(E\_{1},\dots,E\_{K}) is an e-variable for \mathcal{H}.
