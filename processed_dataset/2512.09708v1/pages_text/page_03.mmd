We now recall that the concave envelope \hat{F} of F is defined as the infimum among all concave functions that dominate F. A classical result (see, e.g., Section B.2.5 in Hiriart-Urruty and Lemaréchal 2001) gives

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \hat{F}(\mathbf{u})=\sup\_{n\geq 1}\sup\_{q\in\Delta\_{n}}\sup\left\{\sum\_{j=1}^{% n}q\_{j}F(\mathbf{u}^{(j)})\,\;:\,\;\mathbf{u}^{(j)}\in[0,\infty)^{K}\;\;% \forall j\,,\;\;\sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}\mathbf{u}^{(j)}=\mathbf{u}\right\}\,, |  |

where \Delta\_{n}=\{q\in[0,1]^{n}\,:\,\sum\_{j=1}^{n}q\_{j}=1\}. Combined with 1, this directly yields that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \hat{F}(\mathbf{1})\leq 1\,. |  |

Now, applying the supporting hyperplane theorem (see, *e.g.*, Section A.4.2 in Hiriart-Urruty and Lemaréchal 2001) to the hypograph of \hat{F} (which is a closed convex set) we easily deduce that \hat{F} is dominated by an affine function G such that G(\mathbf{1})=1, namely a G of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | G(\mathbf{u})=1+\sum\_{k=1}^{K}w\_{k}(u\_{k}-1)\,, |  |

with \mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{K}. Note that F (and so \hat{F}) is non-negative on the whole domain [0,\infty)^{K}, and so G as well must be non-negative. This implies that the components of \mathbf{w} are non-negative and have sum at most 1, as required. Since \hat{F} dominates F, we conclude.
