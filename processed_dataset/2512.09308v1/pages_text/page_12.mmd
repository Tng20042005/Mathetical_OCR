ce, the result in (3.22)-(3.23) follows from (3.27). By the generalized dominated convergence theorem \lim\_{\varepsilon\to 0}E{|U\_{\varepsilon}(t,x)-U\_{0}(t,x)|}^{2}=0, which implies the convergence of finite-dimensional distributions.

Finally, to obtain equation (3.2) note that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle{\rm Cov}(U\_{0}(t,x),U\_{0}(t^{\prime},x^{\prime}))=\mathbb{E}U\_{0% }(t,x)U\_{0}(t^{\prime},x^{\prime}) |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle=\mathbb{E}\left(A\_{0}c\_{2}(\kappa\_{0})\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\frac% {e^{i\lambda\_{1}x}}{|\lambda\_{1}|^{\frac{1-\kappa\_{0}}{2}}}E\_{\beta}\left(-\mu t% ^{\beta}|\lambda\_{1}|^{\alpha}\right)\frac{e^{i\lambda\_{2}x^{\prime}}}{{|% \lambda\_{2}|^{\frac{1-\kappa\_{0}}{2}}}}E\_{\beta}\left(-\mu(t^{\prime})^{\beta}% |\lambda\_{2}|^{\alpha}\right)W(d\lambda\_{1})W(d\lambda\_{2})\right) |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle=2A\_{0}c\_{2}(\kappa\_{0})\int\_{0}^{+\infty}\frac{\cos(\lambda(x-x^% {\prime}))}{|\lambda|^{1-\kappa\_{0}}}E\_{\beta}(-\mu t^{\beta}|\lambda|^{\alpha% })E\_{\beta}(-\mu(t^{\prime})^{\beta}|\lambda|^{\alpha})d\lambda, |  |

which completes the proof.

###### Remark 3.3.

Similar to the paper [2], the singularity at the origin ”dominates” all other singularities and completely determines the asymptotic behavior.

Notice that the limit random fields in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 are stationary in the coordinate x and temporally nonstationary in the coordinate t.

###### Example 3.4.

This example demonstrates how the covariance function of the limit field
U\_{0}(t,x), given in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, depends on time,
space, and the parameters. Without loss of generality, we assume that in
(3.2) and (3.2) the constants
\sum\_{j=1}^{n}2c\_{1}(\kappa\_{j})A\_{j}K\_{\frac{\kappa\_{j}-1}{2}}(|w\_{j}|)\,|w\_{%
j}|^{\frac{\kappa\_{j}-1}{2}}
and 2A\_{0}c\_{2}(\kappa\_{0})
are equal to 1. Since the covariance
\mathrm{Cov}\!\left(U\_{0}(t,x),\,U\_{0}(t^{\prime},x^{\prime})\right)
depends on four variables t, t^{\prime}, x, and x^{\prime}, as well as on the parameters
\alpha, \beta, and \mu, we illustrate its behavior using two-dimensional
plots in which some variables are held fixed. We set \mu=\alpha=1, \beta=1/2, and consider the cases of
\kappa\_{0}=0.2,\,0.5, and 0.7.

For the case \beta={1}/{2}, we use the identity
E\_{1/2}(z)=e^{z^{2}}\operatorname{erfc}(-z),
where the Gauss error function is defined by
\operatorname{erf}(z)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int\_{0}^{z}e^{-t^{2}}\,dt.

For t=t^{\prime}=1, Figure 1 shows the covariance as a function of
the spatial increment x-x^{\prime}\in[-15,15]. The covariance is a symmetric function. The figure
also demonstrates that smaller values of \kappa\_{0} yield larger
covariances and slower spatial decay. In contrast, larger values of \kappa\_{0} produce smaller peaks and
more rapid decay as |h| increases.

For x-x^{\prime}=1 and t=1, Figure 2 presents the covariance decreases monotonically
as t^{\prime} increases. As before,
smaller values of \kappa\_{0} yield larger covariance values and slower decay,
while larger values of \kappa\_{0} result in smaller values and more rapid
decay as t^{\prime} grows.
