|  | \frac{L\_{j}\left(\dfrac{1}{|\lambda\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}+w\_{j}|}\right)}{% L\_{0}\left(\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}}\right)}\leq C\_{1}\frac{\max% \left(C,|\lambda\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}+w\_{j}|^{-\nu}\right)}{\varepsilon^{% \nu}}, |  |

for all \lambda, such that \lambda\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}+w\_{j}\neq 0 and \varepsilon\geq\varepsilon\_{0}.

Therefore, the second integral in (LABEL:diffslowly) is bounded by the integral of the same form as the first integral in (LABEL:diffslowly) but with the multiplier \varepsilon^{(1-\kappa\_{0}){\beta/\alpha}-\nu} and with the denominator power 1-\kappa\_{j}+\nu. As \nu>0 can be chosen arbitrarily small, we conclude that the second integral in (LABEL:diffslowly) vanishes, when \varepsilon\to 0.

Now, let us consider the summand corresponding to j=0 in (4). Since the Mittag-Leffer function E\_{\beta}(\cdot) is a monotonically decreasing function of negative arguments and |\theta\_{\kappa\_{0}}(\lambda)|\leq 1 one obtains the next upper bound

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\varepsilon^{(1-\kappa\_{0}){\beta/\alpha}}\int\_{\mathbb{R}}E^{2}\_% {\beta}\left(-\mu|\lambda|^{\alpha}\left(1+|\lambda\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}|% ^{2}\right)^{\gamma/2}t^{\beta}\right)\frac{A\_{0}c\_{2}(\kappa\_{0})}{2}\frac{1-% \theta\_{\kappa\_{0}}(|\lambda\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}|)}{|\lambda\varepsilon^% {\beta/\alpha}|^{\,1-\kappa\_{j}}} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.5) |  | \displaystyle\times\left|1-\frac{L\_{0}\left(\frac{1}{|\lambda\varepsilon^{% \beta/\alpha}|}\right)}{L\_{0}\left(\dfrac{1}{\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}}\right% )}\right|d\lambda\leq A\_{0}c\_{2}(\kappa\_{0})\int\_{0}^{+\infty}\frac{E\_{\beta}^% {2}(-\mu\lambda^{\alpha}t^{\beta})}{\lambda^{1-\kappa\_{0}}}\left|1-\frac{L\_{0}% \left(\dfrac{1}{\lambda\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}}\right)}{L\_{0}\left(\dfrac{1% }{\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}}\right)}\right|d\lambda. |  |

Note that for \nu\in\mathbb{R}, such that |\nu|<\min(1-\kappa\_{0},\kappa\_{0}), it holds

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.6) |  | \int\_{0}^{\infty}\frac{E^{2}\_{\beta}(-\mu\lambda^{\alpha}t^{\beta})}{\lambda^{% 1-\kappa\_{0}-\nu}}d\lambda<+\infty. |  |

Then using Theorems 2.6 and 2.7 in [31] one obtains that the upper bound in (LABEL:onesqch5) approaches 0, when \varepsilon\to 0. The condition (4.6) guarantees the finiteness of the integrals in the conditions of Theorems 2.6 and 2.7 [31]. Note that, instead of the absolute value \left|1-\frac{L\_{0}\left({1}/(\lambda\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha})\right)}{L\_{0}%
\left({\varepsilon^{-\beta/\alpha}}\right)}\right| these theorems use the difference itself. However, in their proofs, the difference appears only in the application of the uniform convergence theorem on the finite interval [\alpha,\beta],\,0<\alpha<\beta<+\infty. So, the results obviously hold true for the absolute value too. Hence, \mathbb{E}\left(U^{(L)}\_{\varepsilon}(t,x)-U\_{0}(t,x)\right)^{2}\to 0, when \varepsilon\to 0, which completes the proof.

## 5. Conclusion

This paper analyzes fractional Riesz–Bessel equations with random initial conditions exhibiting both classical long-range dependence and cyclic long-range dependence. It establishes the convergence of rescaled solutions to spatio-temporal Gaussian random fields and proves multiscaling limit theorems for regularly varying asymptotics.
It would be interesting to generalize the results and further develop the asymptotic approach in the regular-varying cases. Specifically, to study the case with A\_{0}=0, when the classical long-memory component is not present. Also, it would be interesting to study the case of more general classes of regularly varying functions (see, [21, 28, 29]). Finally, generalizations of the results to multidimensional spatial settings and subordinated initial conditions remain challenging open problems.
