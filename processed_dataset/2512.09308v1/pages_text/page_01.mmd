###### Abstract.

This paper investigates fractional Riesz–Bessel equations with random initial conditions. The spectra of these random initial conditions exhibit singularities both at zero frequency and at non-zero frequencies, which correspond to the cases of classical long-range dependence and cyclic long-range dependence, respectively. Using spectral methods and asymptotic theory, it is shown that the rescaled solutions of the equations converge to spatio-temporal Gaussian random fields. The limit fields are stationary in space and non-stationary in time. The covariance and spectral structures of the resulting asymptotic random fields are provided. The paper further establishes multiscaling limit theorems for the case of regularly varying asymptotics. Numerical example illustrating the theoretical results is also presented.

## 1. Introduction

Fractional diffusion and fractional kinetic equations generalize the classical heat and diffusion equations by replacing first- and second-order derivatives with operators of fractional order. Fractional partial differential equations employ nonlocal operators that alow capturing memory effects and long-range interactions, see [19]. Such models often arise in the study of diffusion in porous media with fractal geometry, viscoelastic materials, complex media, seismic wave propagation, anomalous diffusion, and turbulence. Foundational contributions to this field were made by [17], while extensive theoretical frameworks for fractional derivatives, integrals, and operators were subsequently developed, see [27] and [30].

Gay and Heyde [18] demonstrated that fractional Laplace operators generate random fields with long-range dependence. Further analyzes by [4] and [5] focused on stochastic heat equations incorporating fractional Laplace operators. For random initial data exhibiting a singularity of the spectrum at the origin, which corresponds to long-range dependence, Anh and Leonenko [7] proved that suitably rescaled solutions converge to non-Gaussian limits. These results established connections between fractional operators, spectral singularities, and limit theorems.

In this paper, we study fractional partial differential equations with random initial conditions. There is a substantial literature on this topic for non-fractional equations.

Random fields constructed by appropriately rescaling solutions of classical diffusion equations with random initial conditions, were studied by [1] and [24]. The Burgers equation with random forcing, which is connected to the heat equation through the Cole–Hopf transform, has been analyzed in this framework by [25] and [23]. The publications [11, 15, 16] studied a hyperbolic diffusion model on the unit sphere and obtained exact series representations for the solution of the Cauchy problem with random initial conditions. More recently, [14] considered the Cauchy problem for random diffusion in an expanding space–time framework. In addition to deriving probabilistic properties of the solutions, they quantified their extremal behavior by establishing upper bounds for the probabilities of large deviations. Furthermore, Beghin et al. [12] investigated scaling regimes associated with the Airy and Korteweg–de Vries equations. Anh and Leonenko [8, 9] developed renormalization and homogenization techniques for fractional-in-time and fractional-in-space diffusion equations with random inputs. Their results provided non-Gaussian central limit theorems and novel classes of limit random fields and motivated further studies of scaling laws and multiscaling behavior, see [2, 3, 7, 8, 20].

Many results of the modern asymptotic theory use regular variation to generalise classical limit theorems. Regular varying functions, see [13, 31] provide wide, flexible deviations around power laws. Such results are also of great importance in statistics, as for modeling of real data, the exact mathematical power laws are very strict assumptions. For classical long-memory models, the corresponding results and methodology are relatively well developed, see, for example, [6, 22] and the references therein. However, for cyclic long-range dependent models, the singularity location usually changes when studying asymptotic changes, which requires new methods of investigation.

The paper presents several long-memory scenarios of random initial conditions for fractional Riesz–Bessel equations. The corresponding limit theorems are proven and discussed.
