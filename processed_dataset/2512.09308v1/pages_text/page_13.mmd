## 4. Multiscaling limit theorem in the case of regular variation

This section presents a generalization of Theorem 3.2 for the case of regular varying asymptotics. To formulate the corresponding results, we need the following definitions and properties of slowly varying functions.

###### Definition 4.1.

[31]
A function L(\cdot) is slowly varying at infinity if it is real-valued, positive, and measurable on [A,\infty) for some A>0, and satisfies the following condition for every \lambda>0:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lim\_{x\to\infty}\frac{L(\lambda x)}{L(x)}=1. |  |

###### Definition 4.2.

[13]
A measurable function f(\cdot)>0 is regularly varying with index \rho if it satisfies the following asymptotic property:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lim\_{x\to\infty}\frac{f(\lambda x)}{f(x)}=\lambda^{\rho},\quad\lambda>0, |  |

for some finite constant \rho\in\mathbb{R}.

###### Proposition 4.3.

[13, Proposition 1.3.6]
If L varies slowly and \alpha>0,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | x^{\alpha}L(x)\to\infty,\quad x^{-\alpha}L(x)\to 0,\quad(x\to\infty). |  |

We will use the next generalization of Assumplion 2.1 and the spectral density (2.9).

###### Assumption 4.4.

The spectral density of the random process \xi(x) is given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f^{(L)}(\lambda)=\sum\_{j=-n}^{n}\frac{c\_{2}(\kappa\_{j})}{2}A\_{j}\frac{1-\theta% \_{\kappa\_{j}}(|\lambda+w\_{j}|)}{|\lambda+w\_{j}|^{1-\kappa\_{j}}}L\_{j}\left(% \frac{1}{|\lambda+w\_{j}|}\right), |  |

where L\_{j}(\cdot),\,j=-n,...,n, are slowly varying at infinity functions, which are bounded on each finite integral. All other values are the same as in Assumption 2.1.

As can be seeing from this assumption, the spectral density has power-type singularities at the locations w\_{j},\,j=-n,...,n, with the corresponding power-laws parameters 1-\kappa\_{j}. The deviations of the spectral density from this power-laws are given by slowly varying functions L\_{j}(\cdot). The boundedness of functions L\_{j}(\cdot) on each finite interval is required to not introduce other singularities in the spectrum.

###### Theorem 4.5.

Let u(t,x), t>0, x\in\mathbb{R}, be the random field defined by equations (2.1) and (2.2) with the random initial condition \xi(x), which covariance function satisfies Assumption  4.4 with A\_{0}\neq 0. Then, for \alpha>\kappa\_{0}/2, if \varepsilon\to 0, the finite-dimentional distributions of the random fields

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | U^{(L)}\_{\varepsilon}(t,x)=\frac{\varepsilon^{-\frac{\kappa\_{0}\beta}{2\alpha}% }}{L\_{0}\left({\varepsilon^{-\beta/\alpha}}\right)}u\left(\frac{t}{\varepsilon% },\frac{x}{\varepsilon^{\beta/\alpha}}\right),\,t>0,\ x\in\mathbb{R}, |  |
