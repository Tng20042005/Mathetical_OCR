<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A central theme in geometric group theory is the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">large-scale geometry</em> of groups. By this we mean the metric structure that is preserved under quasi-isometries—maps which preserve distances up to a uniformly bounded multiplicative and additive error (Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="2.1. Quasi-isometry ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a>). In a 1983 ICM address <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib111" title="Infinite groups as geometric objects" class="ltx_ref">GRO83</a>]</cite>, Gromov set forth a far-reaching program advocating the study of finitely generated groups as geometric objects and their classification up to quasi-isometry. Among the earliest and most classical quasi-isometric invariants is the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">number of ends</em>. Informally speaking, the number of ends of a simplicial graph is the number of topologically distinct ways to escape to infinity, and the number of ends of a finitely generated group is defined to be the number of ends of its Cayley graph with respect to some (any) finite generating set (Section <a href="#S2.SS2" title="2.2. Number of ends of a graph ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2</span></a>). Freudenthal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="Über die enden topologischer räume und gruppen" class="ltx_ref">FRE30</a>]</cite> and Hopf <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="Enden offener räume und unendliche diskontinuierliche gruppen" class="ltx_ref">HOP43</a>]</cite> independently proved that the number of ends of a finitely generated infinite group is always either one, two, or infinite, where the group has exactly two ends if and only if it contains an infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index. A celebrated theorem of Stallings <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="On torsion-free groups with infinitely many ends" class="ltx_ref">STA68</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="Group theory and three-dimensional manifolds" class="ltx_ref">STA71</a>]</cite> provides a complete characterization of finitely generated groups with infinitely many ends. It states that a finitely generated group has more than one end if and only if it splits over finite groups, or equivalently, it admits an action on a simplicial tree with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions or a global fixed vertex. More generally, infinite countable groups, even when not finitely generated, enjoy the same trichotomy on their number of ends <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib52" title="On the space of ends of infinitely generated groups" class="ltx_ref">COR19</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is a classical fact that the mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, except for some cases when the surface has low complexity, are all one-ended (many even have geodesic divergence bounded above by a quadratic function <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="Divergence of geodesics in Teichmüller space and the mapping class group" class="ltx_ref">DR09</a>]</cite>). So the goal of this paper is to investigate the number of ends of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">big mapping class groups</em>, i.e., mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces (Section <a href="#S2.SS3" title="2.3. Surfaces and the mapping class group ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3</span></a>). Interest in big mapping class groups grew significantly after Bavard <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib35" title="Hyperbolicité du graphe des rayons et quasi-morphismes sur un gros groupe modulaire" class="ltx_ref">BAV16</a>]</cite> proved that the ray graph is Gromov hyperbolic, analogous to the famous theorem of Masur–Minsky <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="Geometry of the complex of curves. I. Hyperbolicity" class="ltx_ref">MM99</a>]</cite> that the curve graph is Gromov hyperbolic. Since then, much effort has been made to understand big mapping class groups and to compare them with the better-studied mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces (see for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="Big mapping class groups are not extremely amenable" class="ltx_ref">LON25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="Compact and finite-type support in the homology of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">PW25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib53" title="Loxodromic elements in big mapping class groups via the Hooper-Thurston-Veech construction" class="ltx_ref">MV22</a>]</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Geometric group theory typically concerns finitely (or compactly) generated groups because it is well-known that the word metrics associated to any two finite (or compact) generating sets are quasi-isometric to each other. Big mapping class groups are not finitely or countably infinitely generated, nor are they compactly generated. So a priori, they do not have a well-defined geometry. However, Rosendal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib114" title="Coarse geometry of topological groups" class="ltx_ref">ROS22</a>]</cite> developed ideas which allow for the study of the large-scale geometry of topological groups which are not locally compact, let alone finitely generated. Specifically, Rosendal proved that for groups which admit a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">coarsely bounded</span> (CB) generating set (Section <a href="#S2.SS5" title="2.5. Geometry of big mapping class groups ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.5</span></a>), it is also the case that the word metrics associated to any two CB generating sets are quasi-isometric to each other. We remark that a subset of a locally compact space is CB if and only if it is compact, so this notion does indeed generalize older ones. Recent work of Mann–Rafi <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="Large scale geometry of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">MR23</a>]</cite> applied this idea to classify (many of) the big mapping class groups which are CB generated, and therefore have a well-defined quasi-isometry type. Using their tools and classification, several results have shown that these groups admit a rich geometric structure (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="Asymptotic dimension of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib112" title="Big mapping class groups with hyperbolic actions: classification and applications" class="ltx_ref">HQR22</a>]</cite>).

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Within this framework, one can now reasonably define the number of ends of a CB generated group to be the number of ends of its Cayley graph with respect to some (any) CB generating set. Then it is natural to ask: <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">How many ends do CB generated big mapping class groups have?</em> A theorem in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="Geometry of nontransitive graphs" class="ltx_ref">OP22</a>]</cite> states that the number of ends of a connected, unbounded, (coarsely) transitive graph is one, two, or infinite, generalizing the theorem of Freudenthal–Hopf. The theorem statement includes an assumption that the graph is locally finite, but in fact, this assumption is unnecessary as it is never used in the proof. The Cayley graph of a CB generated mapping class group is connected and transitive. So even though it is locally infinite (in general, the degree of each vertex is uncountable), we may conclude the following.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">A surface <span id="S1.p5.m1" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span> of infinite type falls into one of two classes depending on whether or not it contains a finite-type <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-displaceable subsurface</span>—a subsurface which intersects its image under every homeomorphism of <span id="S1.p5.m2" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span>.

For example, if <span id="S1.p5.m5" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span> does contain a non-displaceable subsurface of finite type, then <span id="S1.p5.m6" class="ltx_Math">\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)</span> is not coarsely bounded <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="Large scale geometry of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">MR23</a>]</cite> and it admits a continuous and nonelementary action by isometries on a Gromov hyperbolic space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="Big mapping class groups with hyperbolic actions: classification and applications" class="ltx_ref">HQR22</a>]</cite> (the authors also prove that under an extra condition, <span id="S1.p5.m7" class="ltx_Math">\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)</span> admits such an action only if <span id="S1.p5.m8" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span> contains a non-displaceable subsurface). On the other hand, if <span id="S1.p5.m9" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span> does not contain a non-displaceable subsurface and <span id="S1.p5.m10" class="ltx_Math">\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)</span> is not CB, then <span id="S1.p5.m11" class="ltx_Math">\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)</span> has infinite asymptotic dimension <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="Asymptotic dimension of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In an effort to further classify the number of ends of big mapping class groups, we focus on those surfaces <span id="S1.p6.m1" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span> which do not contain a non-displaceable subsurface. Since we are attempting to analyze the large-scale geometry of <span id="S1.p6.m2" class="ltx_Math">\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)</span>, we are only interested in the surfaces for which <span id="S1.p6.m3" class="ltx_Math">\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)</span> is CB generated, but not CB itself. A broad class of surfaces which satisfy these conditions is the class of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">avenue surfaces</span> (Section <a href="#S2.SS6" title="2.6. Avenue surfaces and translatable surfaces ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.6</span></a>). Avenue surfaces were defined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib112" title="Big mapping class groups with hyperbolic actions: classification and applications" class="ltx_ref">HQR22</a>]</cite>, and the only additional condition imposed on them is a weak topological condition called <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">tameness</span> on the space of ends of <span id="S1.p6.m4" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span>. Tameness is rather technical and lengthy to define, so we choose to work within the slightly more restrictive, but much more easily defined, class of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stable</span> surfaces. Stable surfaces form a substantial subclass of tame surfaces, and it has become somewhat standard to work with them. For example, several other works in the literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib116" title="The grand arc graph" class="ltx_ref">BV23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="Asymptotic dimension of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="Classification of stable surfaces with respect to automatic continuity" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> similarly restrict to stable surfaces in order to conveniently work within the framework developed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="Large scale geometry of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">MR23</a>]</cite>. That being said, we expect our results to also hold in the setting of surfaces with tame end spaces.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Every avenue surface has two distinct ends <span id="S1.p7.m1" class="ltx_Math">e_{+}</span> and <span id="S1.p7.m2" class="ltx_Math">e_{-}</span> which are maximal with respect to the partial pre-order <span id="S1.p7.m3" class="ltx_Math">\preceq</span> on <span id="S1.p7.m4" class="ltx_Math">{\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma)</span> defined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib61" title="Large scale geometry of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">MR23</a>]</cite>. It follows from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="Graphs of curves and arcs quasi-isometric to big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">SCH24</a>]</cite> that for every end <span id="S1.p7.m5" class="ltx_Math">x</span> which is an immediate predecessor of <span id="S1.p7.m6" class="ltx_Math">e_{+}</span> (and <span id="S1.p7.m7" class="ltx_Math">e_{-}</span>), the equivalence class of <span id="S1.p7.m8" class="ltx_Math">x</span> is either a discrete set or a totally disconnected perfect set, where the equivalence relation is defined by <span id="S1.p7.m9" class="ltx_Math">\preceq</span>.

On the other hand, one surface which is not covered by our theorem is the Jacob’s ladder surface, which has exactly two ends, each accumulated by genus. It may seem at first that the Jacob’s ladder surface should be no more difficult to handle than the bi-infinite flute surface. However, one significant difference is that in the bi-infinite flute surface, curves cannot meaningfully “interact” with the punctures, since the punctures are not points on the surface, but in the Jacob’s ladder surface, curves may “interact” with the handles in a highly non-trivial way. We do not know whether our methods may be generalized to deal with this additional layer of complexity, so we ask the following.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">A common strategy to study mapping class groups is to construct appropriate metric spaces on which the groups act with good geometric properties. For finite-type surfaces, these spaces are often graphs whose vertices are represented by curves and arcs on the surface, and the fundamental example is the curve graph defined in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="Boundary structure of the modular group" class="ltx_ref">HAR81</a>]</cite>. Avenue surfaces fall in the broader class of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">translatable surfaces</span>, for which Schaffer-Cohen <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="Graphs of curves and arcs quasi-isometric to big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">SCH24</a>]</cite> introduced the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">translatable curve graph</em>, whose vertices correspond to simple closed curves which separate the two maximal ends, and whose edges connect pairs of vertices whenever the corresponding curves bound a subsurface homeomorphic to one of a pre-chosen finite collection of subsurfaces (Section <a href="#S2.SS7" title="2.7. The translatable curve graph ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.7</span></a>). The translatable curve graph is not only an analogue of the curve graph in the setting of translatable surfaces; it is even quasi-isometric to the associated mapping class group <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib115" title="Graphs of curves and arcs quasi-isometric to big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref">SCH24</a>]</cite>. So every property which is invariant under quasi-isometry holds for the mapping class group precisely when it holds for the translatable curve graph. Therefore, we directly analyze the translatable curve graph in order to determine the number of ends of the mapping class group. To this end, we construct an operation called <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">lassoing</span> that takes a vertex in the graph to an adjacent vertex and, more generally, takes a (well-behaved) path to an adjacent path. Furthermore, we find some lower bounds, which we call <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">flux</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Hamming distance</span>, on the graph distance which are crucial to guaranteeing that points are sufficiently far from a given basepoint. Section <a href="#S3" title="3. Example: bi-infinite flute ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> presents a proof of the theorem in the case of the bi-infinite flute, capturing many of the key ideas, and the theorem is proved in full in Section <a href="#S4" title="4.

<p class="ltx_p">The number of ends turns out to be invariant under quasi-isometry. This statement is a well-known fact under conditions such as local finiteness, or local compactness for more general spaces, and proofs may be readily found in the literature (for example, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib109" title="Geometric group theory" class="ltx_ref">DK18</a>, Lemma 9.5]</cite>).

Equivalently, <span id="S3.p1.m6" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma=S^{\natural\mathbb{Z}}</span>, where <span id="S3.p1.m7" class="ltx_Math">S</span> is the annulus with one puncture. In this case, the translatable curve graph <span id="S3.p1.m8" class="ltx_Math">\mathcal{TC}(\Sigma)</span> is the graph whose vertices are (isotopy classes of) separating curves, with an edge between two curves <span id="S3.p1.m9" class="ltx_Math">\alpha</span> and <span id="S3.p1.m10" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> if they have disjoint representatives and <span id="S3.p1.m11" class="ltx_Math">[\alpha,\beta]</span> is homeomorphic to an annulus with one puncture. From now on, denote the translatable curve graph simply by <span id="S3.p1.m12" class="ltx_Math">\Gamma</span>. We first introduce two operations that induce maps on separating curves in <span id="S3.p1.m13" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span>, or equivalently, vertices in <span id="S3.p1.m14" class="ltx_Math">\Gamma</span>. These operations will be referred to as “forgetting a puncture” and “lassoing a puncture”.

<p class="ltx_p">By Theorem <a href="#S2.Thmthm10" title="Theorem 2.10. ‣ 2.7. The translatable curve graph ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.10</span></a>, it suffices to prove that <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m1" class="ltx_Math">\Gamma</span> is one-ended. Fix a vertex <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m2" class="ltx_Math">o\in\Gamma</span> and let <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m3" class="ltx_Math">R&gt;0</span> be any integer. To prove that <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m4" class="ltx_Math">\Gamma</span> is one-ended, it suffices by Lemma <a href="#S2.Thmthm4" title="Lemma 2.4. ‣ 2.2. Number of ends of a graph ‣ 2. Preliminaries and set-up ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4</span></a> to show that for any <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m5" class="ltx_Math">\alpha,\beta\in\Gamma</span> with <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m6" class="ltx_Math">d(\alpha,o)=d(\beta,o)=6R</span>, there exists a path from <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m7" class="ltx_Math">\alpha</span> to <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m8" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> which is disjoint from <span id="S4.SS4.p2.m9" class="ltx_Math">B=B(o,R)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Like in the proof of Theorem <a href="#S3.Thmthm21" title="Theorem 3.21. ‣ 3.5. Main theorem (special case) ‣ 3. Example: bi-infinite flute ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.21</span></a>, the action of <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math">\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)</span> on <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m2" class="ltx_Math">\Gamma</span> allows us to assume that <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m3" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> is the boundary curve of some copy of <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m4" class="ltx_Math">S</span>. Then we may use the translation <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m5" class="ltx_Math">h</span> to push <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m6" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> as far towards <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m7" class="ltx_Math">e_{+}</span> as we want. In total, we may assume without loss of generality that <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m8" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> lies on the right side of <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m9" class="ltx_Math">\alpha</span> such that <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m10" class="ltx_Math">[\alpha,\beta]</span> is full and <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m11" class="ltx_Math">d(\beta,o)\geq 3R</span>. Then Lemma <a href="#S4.Thmthm5" title="Lemma 4.5. ‣ 4.2. Full subsurfaces ‣ 4. Stable avenue surfaces ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.5</span></a> gives a straight path <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m12" class="ltx_Math">(\gamma_{0}=\alpha,\gamma_{1},\dots,\gamma_{k}=\beta)</span> from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m13" class="ltx_Math">\alpha</span> and <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m14" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span>. Since <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m15" class="ltx_Math">\Sigma</span> has at least one class of discrete-type ends, there exists a lasso <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m16" class="ltx_Math">(\eta,\lambda)</span> such that <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m17" class="ltx_Math">\eta\subset\beta_{+}\cap o_{+}</span>, <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m18" class="ltx_Math">C_{\eta}</span> is homeomorphic to <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m19" class="ltx_Math">\widehat{T}_{i}</span> for some <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m20" class="ltx_Math">1\leq i\leq n</span>, and <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m21" class="ltx_Math">\lambda</span> intersects each <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m22" class="ltx_Math">\gamma_{i}</span> exactly once. Consider the lasso path <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m23" class="ltx_Math">(\gamma_{0}(\eta,\lambda),\dots,\gamma_{k}(\eta,\lambda))</span>. Note that <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m24" class="ltx_Math">\alpha</span> and <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m25" class="ltx_Math">\gamma_{0}(\eta,\lambda)</span> are neighbors in <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m26" class="ltx_Math">\Gamma</span>, and so are <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m27" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> and <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m28" class="ltx_Math">\gamma_{k}(\eta,\lambda)</span>. Also, for each <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m29" class="ltx_Math">i=0,\dots,k</span>, Lemma <a href="#S4.Thmthm13" title="Lemma 4.13. ‣ 4.3. Hamming distance ‣ 4. Stable avenue surfaces ‣ The number of ends of big mapping class groups" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.13</span></a> implies that <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m30" class="ltx_Math">H(\gamma_{i}(\eta,\lambda),o)=H(\gamma_{i},o)+1</span>. Since the lasso path is again a straight path, this procedure may be iterated indefinitely, and each iteration produces a new lasso path whose vertices have a Hamming distance from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m31" class="ltx_Math">o</span> increased by 1. Repeat the procedure for a total of <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m32" class="ltx_Math">2R</span> iterations and denote by <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m33" class="ltx_Math">(\gamma_{0}^{\prime},\dots,\gamma_{k}^{\prime})</span> the final path obtained after the last iteration. Then for each <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m34" class="ltx_Math">i=0,\dots,k</span>,</p>
<table id="S4.Ex26" class="ltx_equation ltx_eqn_table">

<tr class="ltx_equation ltx_eqn_row ltx_align_baseline">
<td class="ltx_eqn_cell ltx_eqn_center_padleft"></td>
<td class="ltx_eqn_cell ltx_align_center"><span id="S4.Ex26.m1" class="ltx_Math">d(\gamma_{i}^{\prime},o)\geq H(\gamma_{i}^{\prime},o)=H(\gamma_{i},o)+2R&gt;R.</span></td>
<td class="ltx_eqn_cell ltx_eqn_center_padright"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="ltx_p">So <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m35" class="ltx_Math">(\gamma_{0}^{\prime},\dots,\gamma_{k}^{\prime})</span> is disjoint from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m36" class="ltx_Math">B</span>. Furthermore, the endpoints of the lasso paths constructed in each iteration forms a path from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m37" class="ltx_Math">\alpha</span> to <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m38" class="ltx_Math">\gamma_{0}^{\prime}</span> and a path from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m39" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> to <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m40" class="ltx_Math">\gamma_{k}^{\prime}</span>. The first <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m41" class="ltx_Math">R+1</span> vertices along these paths have a distance of at least <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m42" class="ltx_Math">2R</span> from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m43" class="ltx_Math">o</span> because <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m44" class="ltx_Math">d(\alpha,o),d(\beta,o)\geq 3R</span>. The remaining vertices along these paths have a distance greater than <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m45" class="ltx_Math">R</span> from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m46" class="ltx_Math">o</span> because the Hamming distance is greater than <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m47" class="ltx_Math">R</span>. So these two paths are also disjoint from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m48" class="ltx_Math">B</span>. The concatenation of all three paths then is a path from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m49" class="ltx_Math">\alpha</span> to <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m50" class="ltx_Math">\beta</span> which is disjoint from <span id="S4.SS4.p3.m51" class="ltx_Math">B</span>.
