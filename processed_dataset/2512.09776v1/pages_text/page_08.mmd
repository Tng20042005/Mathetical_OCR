the lasso curves \alpha\_{i}(\ell) one by one, in order of decreasing index starting from i=n, so that \alpha\_{i-1}(\ell) is disjoint from \alpha\_{i}(\ell). This can always be done by drawing the “lasso” portion of \alpha\_{i-1}(\ell) in a small enough neighborhood of \ell. If instead, \ell is an arc from K\_{+} to a puncture p\in K\_{-} which intersects each \alpha\_{i} exactly once, then disjoint lasso curves \alpha\_{i}(\ell) may similarly be drawn. In both constructions, \alpha\_{i}(\ell) lies on the right side of \alpha\_{i-1}(\ell) for each i=1,\dots,n. So the following lemma is true.

###### Lemma 3.8.

A straight sequence of separating curves remains straight after lassoing as above.

Moreover, lassoing a straight path again yields a straight path.

###### Lemma 3.9.

If (\alpha\_{0},\dots,\alpha\_{n}) is a straight path in \Gamma and \ell is a lasso as above, then (\alpha\_{0}(\ell),\dots,\alpha\_{n}(\ell)) is also a straight path in \Gamma.

###### Proof.

Since (\alpha\_{0},\dots,\alpha\_{n}) is a path, each [\alpha\_{i-1},\alpha\_{i}] is an annulus with one puncture. By the construction of the lasso curves \alpha\_{i}(\ell) and \alpha\_{i-1}(\ell) above, [\alpha\_{i-1}(\ell),\alpha\_{i}(\ell)] is also an annulus with the same puncture as [\alpha\_{i-1},\alpha\_{i}]. So \alpha\_{i-1}(\ell) and \alpha\_{i}(\ell) are neighbors in \Gamma.
∎

###### Definition 3.10.

Given a straight path (\alpha\_{0},\dots,\alpha\_{n}) and a lasso \ell as above, the lasso path defined by the \alpha\_{i} and \ell is the straight path (\alpha\_{0}(\ell),\dots,\alpha\_{n}(\ell)).

### 3.4. Flux

The last ingredient needed for this section is the notion of flux. This will provide a lower bound for the graph distance d in \Gamma. For disjoint separating curves \alpha and \beta, define F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta) to be the number of punctures in [\alpha,\beta]. Note that F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=0 if and only if [\alpha,\beta] is an annulus if and only if \alpha and \beta are isotopic. To define the flux between pairs of intersecting curves, the next two lemmas are needed.

###### Lemma 3.11.

If \alpha,\beta,\gamma is a straight sequence of separating curves, then F\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)=F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)+F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma).

###### Proof.

By definition, \beta lies on the right side of \alpha and \gamma lies on the right side of \beta. Then [\alpha,\gamma] is equal to the gluing of [\alpha,\beta] and [\beta,\gamma] along \gamma, and the equation follows.
∎

For separating curves \alpha and \beta, if \gamma is a separating curve in either \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+} or \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}, define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma)=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)-F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma)}\right| |  |

The next lemma shows that the value of F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma) does not depend on the choice of \gamma.

###### Lemma 3.12.

Let \alpha and \beta be separating curves. If \gamma and \gamma^{\prime} are any two separating curves, each of which lies in either \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+} or \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}, then F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma)=F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma^{\prime}).

###### Proof.

Assume without loss of generality that \gamma\subset\alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+}; the case \gamma\subset\alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-} is handled similarly. Then there are two cases corresponding to whether \gamma^{\prime} lies in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+} or \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}. First suppose that \gamma^{\prime} also lies in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+}. Let \gamma^{\prime\prime} be a separating curve in \gamma\_{+}\cap\gamma^{\prime}\_{+}. Then by Lemma 3.11,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma)=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)-F\_{0}(\beta,% \gamma)}\right| | \displaystyle=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)+F\_{0}(\gamma,\gamma^{\prime\prime})-% F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma)-F\_{0}(\gamma,\gamma^{\prime\prime})}\right| |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma^{\prime\prime})-F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma^{% \prime\prime})}\right| |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma^{\prime\prime}). |  |

Replacing \gamma with \gamma^{\prime} in the above calculation also yields F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma^{\prime})=F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma^{\prime\prime}). Hence, F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma)=F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma^{\prime}). Now suppose that \gamma^{\prime} lies in \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}. By Lemma 3.11,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\gamma)=F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\alpha)+F\_{0}(\alpha,% \gamma)\qquad\text{and}\qquad F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\gamma)=F\_{0}(\gamma^{% \prime},\beta)+F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma) |  |

Hence,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma)=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)-F\_{0}(\beta,% \gamma)}\right| | \displaystyle=\left|{F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\gamma)-F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},% \alpha)-F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\gamma)+F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\beta)}\right| |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\left|{F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\alpha)-F\_{0}(\gamma^{\prime},\beta% )}\right| |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma^{\prime}). |  |

∎

This allows for the following definition.

###### Definition 3.13.

Let \alpha and \beta be separating curves. The flux of \alpha and \beta, denoted by F(\alpha,\beta), is defined to be F(\alpha,\beta;\gamma) for some (any) choice of separating curve \gamma in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+} or \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}.

Indeed, this definition agrees with F\_{0} when \alpha and \beta are disjoint.

###### Lemma 3.14.

If \alpha and \beta are disjoint separating curves, then F(\alpha,\beta)=F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta).

###### Proof.

Assume without loss of generality that \beta lies on the right side of \alpha. Let \gamma be a separating curve in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+}=\beta\_{+}. Then by Lemma 3.11,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F(\alpha,\beta)=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)-F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma)}\right|=\left|% {F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)+F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma)-F\_{0}(\beta,\gamma)}\right|=F\_{0}(% \alpha,\beta). |  |

∎

Observe that if \alpha and \beta are neighbors in \Gamma, then [\alpha,\beta] has one puncture and so F(\alpha,\beta)=F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=1. The next lemma implies that F is a pseudometric on \Gamma.
