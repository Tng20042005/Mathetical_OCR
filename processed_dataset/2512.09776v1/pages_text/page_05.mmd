Assume that \Sigma is a surface of infinite type. One of the key tools used in [MR23] was a partial pre-order \preceq on {\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma). By definition, y\preceq x if, for every clopen neighborhood U of x, there exists a clopen neighborhood V of y which is homeomorphic to a subset of U. This induces an equivalence relation on {\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma), where x and y are equivalent ends if x\preceq y and y\preceq x, and we denote by E(x) the equivalence class of x. Denote by \mathcal{M}({\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma)) the subset of {\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma) of ends which are maximal with respect to \preceq, that is, the set of ends x\in{\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma) such that x\preceq y implies y\in E(x). The elements of \mathcal{M}({\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma)) are called *maximal ends*.

For an end x\in{\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma), a clopen neighborhood U of x is *stable* if for any smaller neighborhood U^{\prime}\subset U of x, there is a homeomorphic copy of U contained in U^{\prime}. (see [4, Proposition 3.2] for equivalent definitions of a stable neighborhood). The surface \Sigma is stable if every end x\in{\mathrm{End}}(\Sigma) has a stable neighborhood.

### 2.5. Geometry of big mapping class groups

Let G be a Polish group. A subset A\subset G is coarsely bounded, abbreviated CB, if it has finite diameter with respect to every compatible left-invariant metric on G. A group is locally CB if it has a CB neighborhood of the identity, and it is CB generated if it has a CB generating set. It is a fact that a CB generated group is necessarily locally CB [ROS22, Theorem 1.2]. From the point of view of large-scale geometry, CB sets in Polish groups are analogous to finite sets in discrete groups. In particular, a CB generated group admits a metric that is well-defined up to quasi-isometry.

###### Theorem 2.5.

[ROS22]. Let G be a CB generated Polish group. Then the identity map on G is a quasi-isometry between the word metrics associated to any two symmetric, CB generating sets.

Thus, we can reasonably define the number of ends of CB generated Polish groups, and hence, CB generated big mapping class groups.

###### Definition 2.6.

Let G be a CB generated Polish group, and fix a symmetric CB generating set S. The number of ends of G is the number of ends of the Cayley graph of G with respect to S.

By Theorem 2.5, any other choice of S yields a quasi-isometric Cayley graph which has the same number of ends by Proposition 2.3.

### 2.6. Avenue surfaces and translatable surfaces

Next we recall the definition of an avenue surface and a translatable surface. These notions were introduced in [HQR22] and [SCH24], respectively, and we explain their precise relationship.

###### Definition 2.7 (Avenue surface).

An avenue surface is a connected orientable surface \Sigma which does not contain any non-displaceable subsurface of finite type, whose end space is tame, and whose mapping class group \operatorname{Map}(\Sigma) is CB-generated but not CB.

The condition of tameness only requires that certain ends of \Sigma admit a stable neighborhood. Since we will eventually only consider stable surfaces, where every end admits a stable neighborhood, we refer the interested reader to [MR23] for a precise definition of tame and omit writing it here.

###### Definition 2.8 (Translatable surface).

Given a surface \Sigma, an end e of \Sigma, and a sequence \alpha\_{n} of simple closed curves on \Sigma, we write \lim\_{n\to\infty}\alpha\_{n}=e if for each neighborhood V of e, all but finitely many \alpha\_{n} are contained in V (after isotopy). A homeomorphism h\in\operatorname{Homeo}(\Sigma) is a translation if there are two distinct ends e\_{+} and e\_{-} of \Sigma such that for any simple closed curve \alpha on \Sigma, \lim\_{n\to\infty}h^{n}(\alpha)=e\_{+} and \lim\_{n\to\infty}h^{-n}(\alpha)=e\_{-}. A surface \Sigma is translatable if it admits a translation.

By [SCH24, Theorem 5.3], if a surface \Sigma has tame end space and \operatorname{Map}(\Sigma) is CB generated and not CB, then \Sigma is an avenue surface if and only if it is translatable. In particular, every stable avenue surface is translatable.

In a translatable surface \Sigma, a simple closed curve \alpha is separating if \Sigma\setminus\alpha is disconnected and e\_{+} and e\_{-} are ends of different components. (Note that this condition is stronger than the usual notion of separating which only requires \Sigma\setminus\alpha to be disconnected.) If \alpha is a separating curve, then the component of \Sigma\setminus\alpha with e\_{+} (resp. e\_{-}) as one of its ends is called the right (resp. left) side of \alpha, and it is denoted by \alpha\_{+} (resp. \alpha\_{-}). If \beta is a separating curve that lies on the right side of \alpha, denote by [\alpha,\beta] the subsurface (\alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{-})\cup\alpha\cup\beta of \Sigma with boundary components \alpha and \beta. If \beta lies on the left side of \alpha instead, then by an abuse of notation, still use [\alpha,\beta] to denote [\beta,\alpha].

Next we recall a characterization of translatable surfaces from [SCH24]. Let S be any surface with exactly two boundary components, and denote by S^{\natural\mathbb{Z}} the surface obtained by arranging countably many copies of S like \mathbb{Z} and then gluing consecutive boundary components together in the natural way. By construction, this surface is translatable. Conversely, every translatable surface admits such a decomposition.

###### Proposition 2.9.

[SCH24, Proposition 3.5]
If \Sigma is a translatable surface with translation h, and \alpha is any separating curve, then there is a subsurface S=[\alpha,h^{n}(\alpha)] for some n such that \Sigma is homeomorphic to S^{\natural\mathbb{Z}}.

### 2.7. The translatable curve graph

We now recall the definition of the translatable curve graph from [SCH24]. Let \Sigma=S^{\natural\mathbb{Z}} be a translatable surface and assume that \Sigma is tame. By [SCH24, Lemma 4.4] and [MR23, Proposition 4.7], the end space {\mathrm{End}}(S) has a finite, positive number of equivale
