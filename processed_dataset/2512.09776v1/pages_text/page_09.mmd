###### Lemma 3.15.

All separating curves \alpha,\beta,\gamma satisfy F(\alpha,\beta)\leq F(\alpha,\gamma)+F(\gamma,\beta).

###### Proof.

Let \eta be a separating curve in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+}\cap\gamma\_{+}. Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle F(\alpha,\beta)=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\eta)-F\_{0}(\beta,\eta)}\right| | \displaystyle=\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\eta)-F\_{0}(\gamma,\eta)+F\_{0}(\gamma,\eta)-% F\_{0}(\beta,\eta)}\right| |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\left|{F\_{0}(\alpha,\eta)-F\_{0}(\gamma,\eta)}\right|+\left|{F% \_{0}(\gamma,\eta)-F\_{0}(\beta,\eta)}\right| |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=F(\alpha,\gamma)+F(\gamma,\beta). |  |

∎

However, it can happen that F(\alpha,\beta)=0 for distinct \alpha,\beta. In fact, the Hamming distance (Definition 4.8) can be used to find \alpha and \beta with F(\alpha,\beta)=0 such that d(\alpha,\beta) is arbitrarily large.

The notion of flux is useful yet because it provides a lower bound on the graph distance d in \Gamma.

###### Lemma 3.16.

All separating curves \alpha and \beta satisfy d(\alpha,\beta)\geq F(\alpha,\beta).

###### Proof.

Suppose (\gamma\_{0}=\alpha,\gamma\_{1},\dots,\gamma\_{n}=\beta) is a geodesic path in \Gamma between \alpha and \beta. Since F is a pseudometric by Lemma 3.15,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F(\alpha,\beta)\leq\sum\_{i=0}^{n-1}F(\gamma\_{i},\gamma\_{i+1})=n=d(\alpha,\beta). |  |

∎

It can now be shown that straight paths are geodesic.

###### Lemma 3.17.

If \alpha\_{0},\dots,\alpha\_{n} is a straight path, then d(\alpha\_{0},\alpha\_{n})=n.

###### Proof.

Clearly, d(\alpha\_{0},\alpha\_{n})\leq n. On the other hand, it follows from an inductive argument using Lemma 3.11 that F(\alpha\_{0},\alpha\_{n})=n. Then Lemma 3.16 implies d(\alpha\_{0},\alpha\_{n})\geq n.
∎

In general, flux only gives a lower bound on the graph distance. For disjoint separating curves, however, the flux is equal to the graph distance.

###### Lemma 3.18.

If \alpha and \beta are disjoint separating curves, then there exists a straight path from \alpha to \beta of length F(\alpha,\beta). In particular, d(\alpha,\beta)=F(\alpha,\beta).

###### Proof.

Since \alpha and \beta are disjoint, F(\alpha,\beta)=F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta) is equal to the number of punctures in [\alpha,\beta]. Denote these punctures by p\_{1},\dots,p\_{n}. Put \alpha\_{0}=\alpha. For i=1,\dots,n, inductively define \alpha\_{i} to be the lasso curve \alpha\_{i-1}(\ell\_{i}), where \ell\_{i} is an arc from \alpha\_{i-1} to p\_{i} contained in [\alpha\_{i-1},\beta]. By construction, [\alpha\_{i-1},\alpha\_{i}] is an annulus with one puncture, and so d(\alpha\_{i-1},\alpha\_{i})=1. Moreover, \alpha\_{n} is isotopic to \beta because [\alpha\_{n},\beta] is just an annulus. Hence, \alpha\_{0},\dots,\alpha\_{n} is a straight path from \alpha to \beta of length F(\alpha,\beta). By Lemma 3.17, d(\alpha,\beta)=F(\alpha,\beta).
∎

Lastly, flux gives a notion of left and right for pairs of separating curves which are not disjoint.

###### Definition 3.19.

For separating curves \alpha and \beta, we say that \beta is flux-right of \alpha if F\_{0}(\alpha,\eta)\geq F\_{0}(\beta,\eta) holds for every separating curve \eta in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+}. We say that \beta is flux-left of \alpha if the inequality holds for every separating curve \eta in \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}.

We collect some basic facts about this notion. Lemma 3.11 is used throughout the proof without explicit mention.

###### Lemma 3.20.

Let \alpha and \beta be separating curves. The following statements are true.

1. (1)

   If \beta lies on the right side of \alpha, then \beta is flux-right of \alpha and \alpha is flux-left of \beta.
2. (2)

   \beta must be either flux-right or flux-left of \alpha.
3. (3)

   \beta is flux-right of \alpha if and only if \alpha is flux-left of \beta.
4. (4)

   If \gamma is a separating curve such that \beta is flux-right of \alpha and \gamma is flux-right of \beta, then \gamma is flux-right of \alpha.
5. (5)

   \beta is both flux-right and flux-left of \alpha if and only if F(\alpha,\beta)=0.
