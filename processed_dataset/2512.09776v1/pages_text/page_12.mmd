So d(o,\gamma^{\prime}\_{i})\geq F(o,\gamma^{\prime}\_{i})\geq 2R, which implies \gamma^{\prime}\_{i}\notin B. Thus (\gamma^{\prime}\_{0},\dots,\gamma^{\prime}\_{n}) is disjoint from B.

## 4. Stable avenue surfaces

Now we consider the general setting when \Sigma is a stable avenue surface. Again, we denote by \Gamma the translatable curve graph \mathcal{T}\mathcal{C}(\Sigma) of \Sigma. First we need to establish some notation. If a simple closed curve \eta that does not separate e\_{+} and e\_{-}, but \Sigma\setminus\eta does have two components, then one of the components must have neither e\_{+} nor e\_{-} as an end. The union of this component with \eta is a subsurface of \Sigma with boundary \eta, and it is denoted by C\_{\eta}. If a connected surface T has at least one boundary circle, then denote by \widehat{T} the surface obtained from T by capping a disk onto a boundary circle.

### 4.1. General lassoing and flux

Let \alpha be a separating curve, and let V be a clopen subset of ends contained either in {\mathrm{End}}(\alpha\_{+}) or {\mathrm{End}}(\alpha\_{-}). By the proof of [SCH24, Lemma 4.6], there exists a simple closed curve \eta disjoint from \alpha which bounds V. In particular, \eta does not separate e\_{+} and e\_{-}, and {\mathrm{End}}(C\_{\eta})=V. Moreover, if S has finite positive genus, then for all g\geq 0, \eta may be chosen so that C\_{\eta} has genus g. Let \lambda be an arc which has one endpoint on \eta, is disjoint from \eta otherwise, and intersects \alpha. Denote by \lambda^{\prime} the subarc of \lambda obtained by traveling along \lambda from its endpoint on \eta until the first intersection point with \alpha. In other words, \lambda^{\prime} is the component of \lambda\setminus\alpha containing the endpoint on \eta.

###### Definition 4.1.

Given \alpha, \eta, and \lambda as above, the lasso curve defined by \alpha, \eta, and \lambda, denoted by \alpha(\eta,\lambda), is the simple closed curve obtained by tracing along \alpha, \lambda, and \eta. The pair (\eta,\lambda) and the union \eta\cup\lambda are both referred to as the lasso of \alpha(\eta,\lambda).

Equivalently, \alpha(\eta,\lambda) is the boundary curve of a small tubular neighborhood of \alpha\cup\lambda^{\prime}\cup\eta which is not isotopic to either \alpha or \eta. Observe that by construction, the lasso curve \alpha(\eta,\lambda) is a separating curve disjoint from \alpha, and the end space of [\alpha,\alpha(\eta,\lambda)] is equal to {\mathrm{End}}(C\_{\eta}). Then the following lemma follows from the definition of the translatable curve graph.

###### Lemma 4.2.

Let \alpha be a separating curve and let \alpha(\eta,\lambda) be a lasso curve defined by \alpha and some \eta and \lambda. Then \alpha and \alpha(\eta,\lambda) are neighbors in \Gamma if either of the following conditions is met.

* •

  C\_{\eta} is homeomorphic to \widehat{T}\_{i} for some 1\leq i\leq n,
* •

  C\_{\eta} is homeomorphic to \widehat{T}\_{n+1}.

Let (\alpha\_{0},\dots,\alpha\_{n}) be a straight path in \Gamma. Let \eta be a curve contained in either {\alpha\_{n}}\_{+} or {\alpha\_{0}}\_{-} which bounds a clopen subset of ends, and let \lambda be an arc which has one endpoint on \eta, is disjoint from \eta otherwise, and intersects each \alpha\_{i} exactly once. Then by the same construction and arguments used in the previous section, the lasso path defined by the \alpha\_{i}, \eta, and \ell is the straight path (\alpha\_{0}(\eta,\lambda),\dots,\alpha\_{n}(\eta,\lambda)).

Next we extend the notion of flux for the more general surface \Sigma. For disjoint separating curves \alpha and \beta, define p\_{0}(\alpha,\beta) to be the number of discrete-type ends of [\alpha,\beta], and define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=\begin{cases}\text{genus of }[\alpha,\beta],&\text{if }S% \text{ has finite genus}.\\ 0,&\text{if }S\text{ has infinite genus}.\end{cases} |  |

Then put F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=p\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)+g\_{0}(\alpha,\beta). Now remove the assumption that \alpha and \beta are disjoint. For separating curves \gamma in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+} or \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}, define p(\alpha,\beta;\gamma)=\left|{p\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)-p\_{0}(\beta,\gamma)}\right| and g(\alpha,\beta;\gamma)=\left|{g\_{0}(\alpha,\gamma)-g\_{0}(\beta,\gamma)}\right|. The statements and proofs of Lemma 3.11 and Lemma 3.12 all hold for p\_{0} and g\_{0}. So define p(\alpha,\beta)=p(\alpha,\beta;\gamma) and g(\alpha,\beta)=g(\alpha,\beta;\gamma) for some (any) choice of separating curve \gamma in \alpha\_{+}\cap\beta\_{+} or \alpha\_{-}\cap\beta\_{-}. The flux of separating curves \alpha and \beta is then defined by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F(\alpha,\beta)=p(\alpha,\beta)+g(\alpha,\beta). |  |

Again, whenever \alpha and \beta are disjoint we have p(\alpha,\beta)=p\_{0}(\alpha,\beta) and g(\alpha,\beta)=g\_{0}(\alpha,\beta), and therefore, F(\alpha,\beta)=F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta).

###### Lemma 4.3.

For all separating curves \alpha and \beta, if d(\alpha,\beta)=1 then F(\alpha,\beta)=1.

###### Proof.

By definition of the translatable curve graph \Gamma, d(\alpha,\beta)=1 means that \alpha and \beta are disjoint and [\alpha,\beta] is homeomorphic to some T\in\mathcal{S}. If T=T\_{i} for some i=1,\dots,n, then T has exactly one discrete-type end and its genus is either 0 or infinite. So p\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=1 and g\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=0. If T=T\_{n+1}, then T has no discrete-type ends and its genus is 1. So p\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=0 and g\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=1. In either case, F(\alpha,\beta)=F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=1.
∎

Then the same arguments in the previous section may be used to show that F is a pseudometric on \Gamma which bounds d from below. Also, it is still true in this setting that straight paths are geodesic. On the other hand, Lemma 3.18 does not immediately extend to the more general setting. Indeed, even if \alpha and \beta are disjoint, then it is possible that d(\alpha,\beta)>F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta). This is due to the subtle definition of \Gamma. For example, suppose \Sigma has discrete-type
