ends, but [\alpha,\beta] has genus 1 and no ends. Then F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta)=1, but d(\alpha,\beta)\neq 1 because [\alpha,\beta] is not homeomorphic to T\_{n+1}. However, next we give a sufficient condition on [\alpha,\beta] to guarantee that d(\alpha,\beta)=F(\alpha,\beta).

### 4.2. Full subsurfaces

Recall from Section 2.7 the fixed set \mathcal{R}=\left\{{f\_{1},\dots,f\_{N},c\_{1},\dots,c\_{M}}\right\} of representatives of the equivalence classes of maximal ends of S used to define the translatable curve graph.

###### Definition 4.4.

A subsurface T\subset\Sigma is full if {\mathrm{End}}(T) contains an element of E(f\_{i}) for each i=1,\dots,N and an element of E(c\_{j}) for each j=1,\dots,M. If N=0, then S has finite positive genus and we further require T to have positive genus.

Note that the condition above is readily satisfied. For example, suppose \alpha and \beta are separating curves such that \beta lies on the right side of \alpha. Even if [\alpha,\beta] is not itself full, [\alpha,h(\beta)] must be full because it contains a subsurface homeomorphic to S. The proof of the next lemma resembles the proof that \Gamma is connected [SCH24, Lemma 4.7].

###### Lemma 4.5.

Let \alpha and \beta be disjoint separating curves. If [\alpha,\beta] is full, then there exists a straight path from \alpha to \beta of length F(\alpha,\beta). In particular, d(\alpha,\beta)=F(\alpha,\beta).

###### Proof.

Assume without loss of generality that \beta lies on the right side of \alpha. By [SCH24, Lemma 4.5], the end space of [\alpha,\beta] can be expressed as a disjoint union \bigsqcup\_{i=1}^{k}U\_{i} where each U\_{i} is a stable neighborhood of a maximal end equivalent to one of the representatives in \mathcal{R}=\left\{{f\_{1},\dots,f\_{N},c\_{1},\dots,c\_{M}}\right\} chosen above. Moreover, it follows from stability and maximality that each U\_{i} intersects E(r) for exactly one r\in R. On the other hand, for each representative r\in R, at least one of the U\_{i} intersects E(r) because [\alpha,\beta] is full. In particular, k\geq N+M. Put p=p(\alpha,\beta), and note that N\leq p\leq k. Denote by \left\{{V\_{i}}\right\}\_{i=1}^{p} the set of U\_{i} which are stable neighborhoods of discrete-type ends. The remaining U\_{i} (if any exist) are stable neighborhoods of Cantor-type ends. Note that if U\_{i} and U\_{i^{\prime}} both intersect some E(c\_{j}), then the disjoint union U\_{i}\sqcup U\_{i^{\prime}} is again a stable neighborhood which intersects E(c\_{j}). So the remaining U\_{i} may be combined to form a set \left\{{W\_{i}}\right\}\_{i=1}^{M} where for each i=1,\dots,M, W\_{i} is a stable neighborhood of an end equivalent to c\_{i}. In summary, we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \bigsqcup\_{i=1}^{k}U\_{i}=\left({\bigsqcup\_{i=1}^{\ell}V\_{i}}\right)\sqcup\left% ({\bigsqcup\_{i=1}^{M}W\_{i}}\right). |  |

Put F=F\_{0}(\alpha,\beta) and g=g\_{0}(\alpha,\beta). Since [\alpha,\beta] is full, F=p+g>0. For each 1\leq i\leq M, E(c\_{i})\cap W\_{i} is a Cantor set. So W\_{i} can be expressed as \bigsqcup\_{j=1}^{F}W\_{i,j} where each W\_{i,j} is a stable neighborhood of an end in E(c\_{i}), and is thus homeomorphic to W\_{i}. For 1\leq j\leq p, put Z\_{j}=V\_{j}\sqcup\bigsqcup\_{i=1}^{M}W\_{i,j}, and for p+1\leq j\leq F, put Z\_{j}=\bigsqcup\_{i=1}^{M}W\_{i,j}. Then the end space of [\alpha,\beta] is equal to \bigsqcup\_{j=1}^{F}Z\_{j} and each Z\_{j} is homeomorphic to {\mathrm{End}}(T) for some T\in\mathcal{S}.

Put \alpha\_{0}=\alpha. For j=1,\dots,p, inductively define \alpha\_{j} to be the lasso curve \alpha\_{j-1}(\eta\_{j},\lambda\_{j}), where the lasso \eta\_{j}\cup\lambda\_{j} is contained in [\alpha\_{j-1},\beta], the end space of C\_{\eta\_{j}} is equal to Z\_{j}, and

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{genus}(C\_{\eta\_{j}})=\begin{cases}0\text{ or }\infty,\quad&1\leq j% \leq p,\\ 1,\quad&p<j\leq F.\end{cases} |  |

By construction, for 1\leq j\leq p, [\alpha\_{j-1},\alpha] is homeomorphic to T\_{i}\in\mathcal{S} for some i=1,\dots,n, and for p<j\leq F, [\alpha\_{j-1},\alpha\_{j}] is homeomorphic to T\_{n+1}. Hence, \alpha\_{j-1} and \alpha\_{j} are neighbors in \Gamma for all j=1,\dots,F. Moreover, each \alpha\_{j} lies on the right side of \alpha\_{j-1} by construction, and \alpha\_{F} is isotopic to \beta because [\alpha\_{F},\beta] is an annulus. Therefore, (\alpha\_{0}=\alpha,\dots,\alpha\_{F}=\beta) is a straight path from \alpha to \beta of length F(\alpha,\beta). Since straight paths are geodesic, d(\alpha,\beta)=F(\alpha,\beta).
∎

In fact, if [\alpha,\beta] is full, then every geodesic in \Gamma from \alpha to \beta must be a straight path.

###### Lemma 4.6.

Let \alpha and \beta be disjoint separating curves such that \beta lies on the right side of \alpha and [\alpha,\beta] is full. If (\gamma\_{0}=\alpha,\gamma\_{1},\dots,\gamma\_{n}=\beta) is any geodesic path in \Gamma between \alpha and \beta, then for each i=1,\dots,n, \gamma\_{i} lies on the right side of \gamma\_{i-1}. In particular, \gamma\_{i} lies in [\alpha,\beta] for all i=0,\dots,n.

###### Proof.

Suppose for contradiction that the conclusion fails, and let j be the smallest index for which \gamma\_{j+1} lies on the left side of \gamma\_{j}. Since \gamma\_{i} lies on the right side of \gamma\_{i-1} for each i=1,\dots,j, it follows from an inductive argument that F(\alpha,\gamma\_{j})=j. Let \eta be a separating curve in \alpha\_{-}\cap{\gamma\_{j+1}}\_{-}. Then
