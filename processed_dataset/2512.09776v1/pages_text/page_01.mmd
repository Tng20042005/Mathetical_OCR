###### Abstract.

We analyze the number of ends of the mapping class group of a stable avenue surface. We prove that the mapping class group is one-ended whenever the stable avenue surface has at least one end of discrete type. Our method is to show that the associated translatable curve graph, which is quasi-isometric to the mapping class group, is one-ended.

## 1. Introduction

A central theme in geometric group theory is the *large-scale geometry* of groups. By this we mean the metric structure that is preserved under quasi-isometries—maps which preserve distances up to a uniformly bounded multiplicative and additive error (Section 2.1). In a 1983 ICM address [GRO83], Gromov set forth a far-reaching program advocating the study of finitely generated groups as geometric objects and their classification up to quasi-isometry. Among the earliest and most classical quasi-isometric invariants is the *number of ends*. Informally speaking, the number of ends of a simplicial graph is the number of topologically distinct ways to escape to infinity, and the number of ends of a finitely generated group is defined to be the number of ends of its Cayley graph with respect to some (any) finite generating set (Section 2.2). Freudenthal [FRE30] and Hopf [HOP43] independently proved that the number of ends of a finitely generated infinite group is always either one, two, or infinite, where the group has exactly two ends if and only if it contains an infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index. A celebrated theorem of Stallings [STA68, STA71] provides a complete characterization of finitely generated groups with infinitely many ends. It states that a finitely generated group has more than one end if and only if it splits over finite groups, or equivalently, it admits an action on a simplicial tree with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions or a global fixed vertex. More generally, infinite countable groups, even when not finitely generated, enjoy the same trichotomy on their number of ends [COR19].

It is a classical fact that the mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces, except for some cases when the surface has low complexity, are all one-ended (many even have geodesic divergence bounded above by a quadratic function [DR09]). So the goal of this paper is to investigate the number of ends of *big mapping class groups*, i.e., mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces (Section 2.3). Interest in big mapping class groups grew significantly after Bavard [BAV16] proved that the ray graph is Gromov hyperbolic, analogous to the famous theorem of Masur–Minsky [MM99] that the curve graph is Gromov hyperbolic. Since then, much effort has been made to understand big mapping class groups and to compare them with the better-studied mapping class groups of finite-type surfaces (see for example, [LON25, PW25, MV22]).

Geometric group theory typically concerns finitely (or compactly) generated groups because it is well-known that the word metrics associated to any two finite (or compact) generating sets are quasi-isometric to each other. Big mapping class groups are not finitely or countably infinitely generated, nor are they compactly generated. So a priori, they do not have a well-defined geometry. However, Rosendal [ROS22] developed ideas which allow for the study of the large-scale geometry of topological groups which are not locally compact, let alone finitely generated. Specifically, Rosendal proved that for groups which admit a coarsely bounded (CB) generating set (Section 2.5), it is also the case that the word metrics associated to any two CB generating sets are quasi-isometric to each other. We remark that a subset of a locally compact space is CB if and only if it is compact, so this notion does indeed generalize older ones. Recent work of Mann–Rafi [MR23] applied this idea to classify (many of) the big mapping class groups which are CB generated, and therefore have a well-defined quasi-isometry type. Using their tools and classification, several results have shown that these groups admit a rich geometric structure ([9, HQR22]).

Within this framework, one can now reasonably define the number of ends of a CB generated group to be the number of ends of its Cayley graph with respect to some (any) CB generating set. Then it is natural to ask: *How many ends do CB generated big mapping class groups have?* A theorem in [OP22] states that the number of ends of a connected, unbounded, (coarsely) transitive graph is one, two, or infinite, generalizing the theorem of Freudenthal–Hopf. The theorem statement includes an assumption that the graph is locally finite, but in fact, this assumption is unnecessary as it is never used in the proof. The Cayley graph of a CB generated mapping class group is connected and transitive. So even though it is locally infinite (in general, the degree of each vertex is uncountable), we may conclude the following.

###### Observation 1.1.

The number of ends of a CB generated mapping class group is zero, one, two, or infinite. The number of ends is zero if and only if the group is CB.
