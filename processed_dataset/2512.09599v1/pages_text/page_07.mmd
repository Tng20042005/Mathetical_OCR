then one has up to (extra) probability e^{-\epsilon^{-1-\delta\_{2}}}, for some \delta\_{2}>0,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|u(t)-u\_{app}(t)\|\_{L\_{t}^{\infty}H^{s}[t\_{0},t\_{0}+1]}\lesssim\epsilon^{-% \frac{1}{2}} |  | (5.2) |

###### Proof of Lemma 5.1.

Recall X^{s,b} embeds into L\_{t}^{\infty}H^{s}, estimate (3.12) implies

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|e^{2it\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{2}^{2}}u(t)-e^{2it\_{0}\epsilon^{2% }\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{2}^{2}}e^{i(t-t\_{0})\Delta}u(t\_{0})\|\_{L\_{t}^{\infty% }H^{s}[t\_{0},t\_{0}+1]}\leq\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2}-\delta\_{1}} |  | (5.3) |

Now we note that

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle e^{2it\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}}(u-upp)(t)= | \displaystyle e^{2it\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}}u(t)-e^{2% it\_{0}\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}}u(t\_{0}) |  | (5.4) |
|  | \displaystyle+ | \displaystyle e^{2it\_{0}\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}}e^{i(t% -t\_{0})\Delta}u(t\_{0})-e^{i(t-t\_{0})\Delta}u\_{app}(t\_{0}) |  |
|  | \displaystyle+ | \displaystyle e^{i(t-t\_{0})\Delta}u\_{app}(t\_{0})-e^{2it\epsilon^{2}\|u\_{0}\|\_{% 2}^{2}}u\_{app(t)} |  |

Note that phase e^{2it\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}} does not change H^{s}.
The first term in RHS of (5.4) is controlled via (5.3). The second term is controlled by (5.1).

The third term can be controlled via the explicit formula of u\_{app},

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\|e^{i(t-t\_{0})\Delta}u\_{app}(t\_{0})-e^{2it\epsilon^{2}\|u\_{0}\|\_% {2}^{2}}u\_{app(t)}\|\_{H^{s}}^{2}\lesssim\sum\_{n}|c\_{n}g\_{n}|^{2}|t-t\_{0}|^{2}(% \epsilon^{2}c\_{n}^{2}|g\_{n}|^{2})^{2}n^{2s} |  | (5.5) |
|  | \displaystyle\lesssim\sum\_{n}\langle n\rangle^{-3-6\theta}\langle n\rangle^{2s% }|g\_{n}|^{6}\epsilon^{4} |  |

The desired estimates follows now from Lemma 2.1, (or by computing the probability |g\_{n}|\leq<n>^{0+}\epsilon^{-(\frac{1}{2}+)})
∎

We now apply Lemma 5.1 and (assuming) Lemma 3.6 to close the proof of Lemma 3.3.

###### Proof.

It follows standard continuity argument. Note that we are doing an upper bound estimate for\mathbb{P}(\|u-u\_{app}\|\_{L\_{t}^{\infty}H^{s}([0,T\_{\epsilon}]\times\mathbb{T}%
)}\geq\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}+\delta\_{1}})\mathbb{P}(\|u-u\_{app}\|\_{L\_{t}^{%
\infty}H^{s}([0,T\_{\epsilon}]\times\mathbb{T})}\geq\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}+%
\delta\_{1}}), and F\_{\epsilon}^{c} and E\_{\epsilon} in Lemma 3.6 admits small enough probability for the estimate in Lemma 3.3. Everytime, we apply Lemma 5.1 to extend the solution for extra time interval of Length 1, which will force us to drop e^{-\epsilon^{-1-\delta\_{2}}}. We need to drop at most \sim 1/\epsilon times, and such a loss of probability is allowed. We leave the left to interested readers.

∎

We now turn to the proof of Lemma 3.6.

Lemma 3.6 can be reduced to the following Lemma via a Gronwall argument.

###### Lemma 5.2.

Under the assumption of Lemma 3.6. Assuming bootstrap hypothesis (3.13) for [0,T]. There exists a set E\_{\epsilon} with probability measure e^{-\epsilon^{-1-\delta\_{3}}} for some \delta\_{3}>0, such that for all \omega\in F\_{\epsilon}-E\_{\epsilon}:
one has for some C,C\_{3}>0
