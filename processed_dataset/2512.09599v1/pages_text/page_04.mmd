|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{P}\left(\left\|u\_{\mathrm{app}}\right\|\_{L\_{x,t}^{\infty}}>z\_{0}% \epsilon^{-1/2}-\epsilon^{-1/2+\delta\_{1}}\right)+\mathbb{P}\left(\left\|u-u\_{% \mathrm{app}}\right\|\_{C\_{t}[0,T\_{\epsilon}]H^{s}}>\epsilon^{-1/2+\delta\_{1}}\right) |  | (3.6) |

Via Lemma 3.1, the first term in (3.6) is bounded by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | e^{-\frac{\epsilon^{-1}z\_{0}^{2}}{\sum\limits\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}c\_{k}^{2}}+o(% \epsilon^{-1})}. |  | (3.7) |

Via Lemma 3.3, the second term is bounded by e^{-C\_{0}\epsilon^{-1}} for C\_{0} large.

Thus, we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{P}(\left(\sup\limits\_{t\in[0,T\_{\epsilon}]}\sup\limits\_{x\in\mathbb{T}% }|u(t,x)|>z\_{0}\epsilon^{-1/2}\right)\leq 2e^{-\frac{\epsilon^{-1}z\_{0}^{2}}{% \sum\limits\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}c\_{k}^{2}}+o(\epsilon^{-1})} |  | (3.8) |

Lower bound is similar, (the point is that we use LDP for the modified linear flow and only need an upper bound of probability to control the error by Lemma 3.3) and we get

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{P}\left(\sup\limits\_{t\in[0,T\_{\epsilon}]}\sup\limits\_{x\in\mathbb{T}}% |u(t,x)|>z\_{0}\epsilon^{-1/2}\right)\geq\frac{1}{2}e^{-\frac{\epsilon^{-1}z\_{0% }^{2}}{\sum\limits\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}c\_{k}^{2}}+o(\epsilon^{-1})} |  | (3.9) |

Combine (3.9) and (3.8), the desired LDP estimate for u follows.

∎

By [7, Lemma 4.2] or [9, Lemma 4.2], \eta is a standard complex Gaussian if and only \eta e^{it|\eta|^{2}} is a standard complex Gaussian. Our proof for Lemma 3.1 actually yields to the same result555We will not use this result in the proof, and strictly speaking those two results, though same, are not equivalent, but we feel it is good to record this estimate for linear flow here. for the linear free flow.

###### Lemma 3.4.

Let z\_{0}>0, T\_{\epsilon}=O(\epsilon^{-1}) and u\_{0} be as in (3.1), one has the large deviation principle

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lim\_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}}\epsilon\ln\mathbb{P}(\|e^{it\Delta}u\_{0}\|\_{L% \_{t,x}^{\infty}([0,T\_{\epsilon}]\times\mathbb{T})}>z\_{0}\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}% })=-\frac{z\_{0}^{2}}{\sum\_{n}c\_{n}^{2}} |  | (3.10) |

We will prove Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.4 in Section 4.

Lemma 3.3 mainly follows from the following two lemmas.

The first one is random data local theory

###### Lemma 3.5.

Let u,u\_{app},T\_{\epsilon} be as in Lemma 3.3. For all (fixed) 0<\delta\_{1}\ll 1 and \theta>0. There exists some s>\frac{1}{2}, so that the following holds.

Assume that for some t\_{0}\leq T\_{\epsilon}, one has

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|u(t\_{0})-u\_{app}(t\_{0})\|\_{H^{s}\_{x}}\leq\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}}, |  | (3.11) |

then one has up to (extra) probability e^{-\epsilon^{-1-\delta\_{2}}}, for some \delta\_{2}>0,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|e^{2it\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{2}^{2}}u(t)-e^{2it\_{0}\epsilon^{2% }\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{2}^{2}}e^{i(t-t\_{0})\Delta}u(t\_{0})\|\_{X^{s,b}[t\_{0}% ,t\_{0}+1]}\leq\epsilon^{\frac{1}{2}-\delta\_{1}} |  | (3.12) |

###### Proof.

Lemma 3.5 lies essentially in [2, 3], see in particular [4], Proposition 4.6, and Lemma 4.9. All aforementioned works focus on the regularity issue, i.e. the part s>\frac{1}{2}. However, its easy to see the size also matches. Si
