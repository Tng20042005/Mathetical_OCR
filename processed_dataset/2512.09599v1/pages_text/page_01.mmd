###### Abstract

In this article, we revisit the work of [7], and prove large deviation principles for more general random initial data for cubic NLS. The Fourier coefficient of our random data admits an optimal polynomial decay.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Statement of results

Consider cubic NLS on 1d torus \mathbb{T},

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \begin{cases}iu\_{t}+\Delta u=\epsilon^{2}|u|^{2}u,\\ u(0,x)=u\_{0}(x)\end{cases} |  | (1.1) |

here \epsilon>0 is a parameter.

We will focus on the random initial data of type

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | u^{\omega}\_{0}(x)=\sum\_{n}c\_{n}g\_{n}^{\omega}e^{inx} |  | (1.2) |

where c\_{n}=\langle n\rangle^{-(\frac{1}{2}+\theta)},\theta>0, and g\_{n}^{\omega} be i.i.d standard complex Gaussian.

Note that u^{\omega}\_{0}\in L\_{x}^{2} almost surely, and it is well known that all L^{2} initial data generates a global flow, [1]. Our main result is

###### Theorem 1.1.

Consider (1.1) with random initial data (1.2). Let c\_{n} in (1.2) be \langle n\rangle^{-(\frac{1}{2}+\theta)},\theta>0. Let T\_{\epsilon}\approx\epsilon^{-1}. One has the following large deviation principle

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lim\_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}}\epsilon\ln\mathbb{P}(\|u^{\omega}\|\_{L^{% \infty}\_{t,x}([0,T\_{\epsilon}]\times\mathbb{T})}>z\_{0}\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}})% =-\frac{z\_{0}^{2}}{\sum\_{n}|c\_{n}|^{2}}. |  | (1.3) |

###### Remark 1.2.

Upon finishing of this work, we notice a recent preprint of Liang-Wang, [8], which handles Theorem 1.1 in the case \theta>\frac{1}{2}. It should be noted that when \theta>\frac{1}{2}, the Fourier coefficient is in l^{1}, which forms an algebra. We handle all \theta>0.

Both [7], [8], and this work actually work for time scale for c\epsilon^{-1}|\ln\epsilon|, for some c small but universal. Such improvement comes from standard improvement in Gronwall argument. In [8], they state the time scale as O(\epsilon^{-1}|\ln\epsilon|), however, it seems hard to cover time scale for C\epsilon^{-1}|\ln\epsilon| for C large, see the line below (3.30) in [8].

### 1.2 Background and motivation

This work is inspired by the pioneering work [7]. Motivated by rogue wave phenomena, Garrido, Grande, Kurianski and Staffilani study (1.1), with random initial data of form (1.2), but for c\_{n}=ae^{-b|n|}. They essentially
