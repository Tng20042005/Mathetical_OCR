The overall strategy to approach Theorem 1.1, as in [7], is to prove a precise LDP for the (modified) linear flow, and prove that the difference of u and the (modified) linear flow is small with probability close to 1.

Let modified linear flow u\_{app} be defined as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | u\_{app}(t,x):=e^{-2it\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L\_{x}^{2}}^{2}}\sum\_% {n}c\_{n}g\_{n}e^{inx}e^{it\epsilon^{2}c\_{n}^{2}|g\_{n}|^{2}-itn^{2}}. |  | (3.2) |

(Strictly speaking, u\_{app} depends on \epsilon, for notation simplicity, we hide this \epsilon.)

Note that u\_{app} solves

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \begin{cases}i\partial\_{t}u\_{app}+\Delta u\_{app}=-\epsilon^{2}\mathcal{N}\_{2}(% u\_{app})+2\epsilon^{2}\frac{1}{2\pi}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L\_{x}^{2}}u\_{app},\\ u\_{app}(0,x)=u\_{0}(x)\end{cases} |  | (3.3) |

We refer to (1.4), (1.5), (1.6) for the notation \mathcal{N}\_{2}.

Theorem 1.1 follows from the following two lemmas.

###### Lemma 3.1.

Let z\_{0}>0, T\_{\epsilon}=O(\epsilon^{-1}) and u\_{app} be defined as (3.2), one has the large deviation principle,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lim\_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0^{+}}\epsilon\ln\mathbb{P}(\|u\_{app}\|\_{L\_{t,x}^{% \infty}([0,T\_{\epsilon}]\times\mathbb{T})}>z\_{0}\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}})=-% \frac{z\_{0}^{2}}{\sum\_{n}c\_{n}^{2}} |  | (3.4) |

###### Remark 3.2.

One can see from our proof that the result actually holds for T\_{\epsilon}=e^{o(\epsilon^{-1})}.

and

###### Lemma 3.3.

Let u\_{0} be as in (3.1), and u\_{app} be as in (3.2). Let u be the associated solution to (1.1) with initial data u\_{0}. Let \theta>0 be fixed. Let T\_{\epsilon}=O(\epsilon^{-1}). Let C\_{0}\gg 1. Then there exists s>\frac{1}{2}, and \delta\_{1}>0, so that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | -\ln\mathbb{P}(\|u-u\_{app}\|\_{L\_{t}^{\infty}H^{s}([0,T\_{\epsilon}]\times% \mathbb{T})}\geq\epsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}+\delta\_{1}})\geq C\_{0}\epsilon^{-1} |  | (3.5) |

Once Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.3 are established, Theorem 1.1 follows by the similar argument as in [7].

###### Proof of Theorem 1.1 assuming Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.3..

We first explain the overall idea.
  
Since we are computing large deviation for \|u\|\_{L^{\infty}} at scale \epsilon^{-1/2}, any error of form of \epsilon^{-1/2+\delta},\delta>0 is irrelevant. It does take a probability e^{-C\_{0}\epsilon^{-1}} to reduce u to u\_{app}. But here C\_{0} can be chosen as arbitrary large.
  
Note that for any c fixed, -\epsilon\ln(e^{-c\epsilon^{-1}}+e^{-C\_{0}\epsilon^{-1}})\rightarrow c for all C\_{0} large than c.

We present more details for the convenience of readers.

We start with an upper bound for \mathbb{P}(\left(\sup\limits\_{t\in[0,T\_{\epsilon}]}\sup\limits\_{x\in\mathbb{T}%
}|u(t,x)|>z\_{0}\epsilon^{-1/2}\right). It is bounded by
