* (a)

  Since the summation of (6.2) for r=1,2,3 gives

  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (6.4) |  | [T]^{3}-T\sim 3(1-c)\frac{T}{\ln T}, |  |

  | (6.5) |  | [T]^{3}-[T+2l\_{3}]^{1}-T-2l\_{3}\sim(1-c)\frac{T}{\ln T}, |  |

  | (6.6) |  | [T]^{3}-[T+2l\_{3}]^{1}-T-2l\_{3}\sim 2(1-c)\frac{T}{\ln T},\ T\to\infty, |  |

  for every fixed l\_{3}>0. Consequently, it is true that

  Since the summation of (6.2) for r=1,2,3,4 gives

  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (6.8) |  | [T]^{4}-T\sim 4(1-c)\frac{T}{\ln T}, |  |

  and the summation for r=1,2,3 with the substitution

  | (6.11) |  | [T]^{4}-[T+2l\_{2}]^{3}\sim(1-c)\frac{T}{\ln T}. |  |

  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (6.12) |  | [T]^{4}>[T+2l\_{2}]^{3},\ T\to\infty, |  |

  and the inequality holds true with a big reserve.
* (c)

  Only 0-adjacent interval corresponds to the first and the second of intervals in (6.1).

###### Remark 9.

It is true that the set of intervals (6.1) is the disconnected set with the big measures of the second and the third adjacent intervals, comp. (6.6) and (6.11).

## 7. Concluding remarks

### 7.1.

Let us remind that the oval of Cassini is the locus traced out by a point M moving so that the product of its distances from two given points F\_{1} and F\_{2} is constant
