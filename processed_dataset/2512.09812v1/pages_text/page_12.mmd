###### Remark 8.

The formula (5.8) expresses the asymptotic factorization of the excess (1.10) by means of the basic set of integrals

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.10) |  | \begin{split}&\left\{\int\_{T}^{[T]^{1}}Z^{2}(t){\rm d}t,\ \int\_{[T]^{1}}^{[T+2% l\_{3}]^{1}}Z^{2}(t){\rm d}t\right.\\ &\left.\int\_{[T]^{3}}^{[T+2l\_{2}]^{3}}\prod\_{r=0}^{2}Z^{2}(\varphi\_{1}^{r}(t))% {\rm d}t,\ \int\_{[T]^{4}}^{[T+2l\_{1}]^{4}}\prod\_{r=0}^{3}Z^{2}(\varphi\_{1}^{r}% (t)){\rm d}t\right\},\end{split} |  |

where, of course,

|  | [G]^{r}=\varphi\_{1}^{r}(G), |  |

on the other two-parametric system of lemniscates of Bernoulli \bar{\mathcal{L}}[l\_{3},v].

## 6. On the structure of the set of intervals under question

### 6.1.

Our results listed above contain integrations over the intervals

We use the formula191919Comp. (2.14).

where
