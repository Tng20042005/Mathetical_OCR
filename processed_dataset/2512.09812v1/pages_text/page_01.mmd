###### Abstract.

In our paper from 1985 we have constructed two integrals of the Riemann’s function Z^{2}(t) over two disconnected sets with asymptotically equal measures such that these two integrals differ by considerably big excess. In the present paper we use the formula for that excess to construct a new \zeta-equivalent of the Fermat-Wiles theorem on a two-parametric set of lemniscates of Bernoulli.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1.

Let us remind the Hardy-Littlewood integral111See [1]

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.1) |  | J=\int\_{0}^{T}\left|\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d}t,\ T>0. |  |

We have obtained in our paper [2] some new facts about the structure of the increments

|  |  |  |  |

| (1.2) |  | \int\_{T}^{T+U}\left|\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d}t,\ U=T^% {5/12}\ln^{3}T |  |

of the Hardy-Littlewood integral as it follows.

### 1.2.

At first, let us remind the following notions connected with the Riemann’s function

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.3) |  | Z(t)=e^{i\vartheta(t)}\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right);\ Z(t)\in\mathbb{R}\ % \mbox{if}\ t\in\mathbb{R}, |  |

where222See [11], (35), (44), (62), comp. [12], p. 98.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.4) |  | \vartheta(t)=-\frac{t}{2}\ln\pi+\operatorname{Im}\ln\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}+i% \frac{t}{2}\right)=\frac{t}{2}\ln\frac{t}{2\pi}-\frac{t}{2}-\frac{\pi}{8}+% \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{t}\right). |  |

Of course, it is true that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.5) |  | \left|\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|=|Z(t)|. |  |

Let us put (see (1.4))

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \vartheta\_{1}(t)=\frac{t}{2}\ln\frac{t}{2\pi}-\frac{t}{2}-\frac{\pi}{8}. |  |

In our paper [3] we have defined the following set of sequences

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.6) |  | \{g\_{\nu}(\tau)\}\_{\nu=1}^{\infty},\ \tau\in[-\pi,\pi], |  |

where, see [3], (6),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.7) |  | \vartheta\_{1}[g\_{\nu}(\tau)]=\frac{\pi}{2}\nu+\frac{\tau}{2};\ g\_{\nu}(0)=g\_{% \nu}. |  |

Next, we have defined333See [3], p. 25. two systems of disconnected sets
