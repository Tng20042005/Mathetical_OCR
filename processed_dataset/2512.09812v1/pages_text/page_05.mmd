For completeness, we give here some basic geometrical properties related to Jacob’s ladders. These are generated by the sequence

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.8) |  | T\to\left\{\overset{r}{T}(T)\right\}\_{r=1}^{k} |  |

of reverse iterations of the Jacob’s ladders for every sufficiently big T>0 and every fixed k\in\mathbb{N}.

###### Property 1.

The sequence (2.8) defines a partition of the segment [T,\overset{k}{T}] as follows

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.9) |  | |[T,\overset{k}{T}]|=\sum\_{r=1}^{k}|[\overset{r-1}{T},\overset{r}{T}]| |  |

on the asymptotically equidistant parts

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.10) |  | \begin{split}&\overset{r}{T}-\overset{r-1}{T}\sim\overset{r+1}{T}-\overset{r}{% T},\\ &r=1,\dots,k-1,\ T\to\infty.\end{split} |  |

###### Property 2.

Simultaneously with the Property 1, the sequence (2.8) defines the partition of the integral

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.11) |  | \int\_{T}^{\overset{k}{T}}\left|\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d}t |  |

into the parts

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.12) |  | \int\_{T}^{\overset{k}{T}}\left|\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d% }t=\sum\_{r=1}^{k}\int\_{\overset{r-1}{T}}^{\overset{r}{T}}\left|\zeta\left(% \frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d}t, |  |

that are asymptotically equal

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.13) |  | \int\_{\overset{r-1}{T}}^{\overset{r}{T}}\left|\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)% \right|^{2}{\rm d}t\sim\int\_{\overset{r}{T}}^{\overset{r+1}{T}}\left|\zeta% \left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d}t,\ T\to\infty. |  |

It is clear, that (2.10) follows from (2.3) and (2.5) since

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.14) |  | \overset{r}{T}-\overset{r-1}{T}\sim(1-c)\frac{\overset{r}{T}}{\ln\overset{r}{T% }}\sim(1-c)\frac{T}{\ln T},\ r=1,\dots,k, |  |

while our eq. (2.13) follows from (2.6) and (2.5).

## 3. Some next remarks about the result (1.10) of the paper [3]

Since the paper [3] has been published 40 years ago in almost unknown journal, we give here some complements to formulae (1.8) – (1.12).

### 3.1.

We start with the following remarks.

###### Remark 5.

Since, see (1.17),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.1) |  | g\_{2\nu}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=g\_{2\nu+1}\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right), |  |

then we have the systems of two disconnected sets

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.2) |  | \{G\_{3}(v)\},\ \{G\_{4}(w)\},\ 0<v,w\leq\frac{\pi}{2} |  |
