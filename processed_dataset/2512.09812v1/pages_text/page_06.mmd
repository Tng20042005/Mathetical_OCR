###### Remark 6.

We have used the symbols x,y in our paper [3] instead of v,w used in the present paper, where x and y are reserved for the contact with the Fermat-Wiles theorem.

where

| (3.5) |  | g\_{2\nu}(-v),g\_{2\nu+1}(w)\in[T,T+U],\ 0<v,w\leq\frac{\pi}{2}, |  |

then for measures of the sets G\_{3}(v) and G\_{4}(w) we have the following formulae

|  |  |  |  |

| (3.6) |  | \begin{split}&m[G\_{3}(v)]=\frac{v}{\pi}U+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{v}{\ln T}% \right),\\ &m[G\_{4}(v)]=\frac{w}{\pi}U+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{w}{\ln T}\right),\end{split} |  |

###### Remark 7.

Let us denote

| (3.8) |  | G\_{3}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=\bar{G}\_{3},\ G\_{4}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=% \bar{G}\_{4}. |  |

Then, see (3.6),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.9) |  | m[\bar{G}\_{3}]+m[\bar{G}\_{4}]=U+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\ln T}\right),\ T\to\infty. |  |

### 3.3.

Finally, we present, for completeness, next two results of the paper [3]. Namely, the formulae

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.10) |  | \begin{split}&\int\_{G\_{3}(v)}Z^{2}(t){\rm d}t\sim\int\_{G\_{4}(v)}Z^{2}(t){\rm d% }t\sim\frac{v}{\pi}U\ln T,\ T\to\infty,\end{split} |  |

and also the formula for the difference of the two integrals
