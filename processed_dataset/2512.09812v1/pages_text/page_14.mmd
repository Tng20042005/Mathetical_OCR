* (\beta)

  In the case b<a the curve consists of two separated ovals. Each of points F\_{1}, F\_{2} is surrounded by one of these ovals.
* (\gamma)

  In the case b>a the curve is an oval with both pints F\_{1},F\_{2} in its interior.

### 7.2.

Since we wish to keep a^{2} with

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (7.3) |  | a=\left(\frac{4}{\pi}\sin v\right)^{6/5}\left(\frac{1}{8l\_{3}}\right)^{1/2},\ % l\_{3}>0,\ 0<v\leq\frac{\pi}{2} |  |

on the right-hand side of (7.1), we put

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (7.4) |  | |F\_{5}M||F\_{6}M|=a^{2}, |  |

where

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (7.5) |  | F\_{5}=F\_{5}(c,0),\ F\_{6}=F\_{6}(-c,0). |  |

We, however, do not with to introduce a new parameter c, so we shall consider only following two possibilities

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (7.6) |  | c=\frac{1}{2}a,\ c=2a |  |

in (7.4), (7.5).
