### 5.2.

Now, we use the following condition for the asymptotic equality151515Comp. (4.6).

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.4) |  | \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\sin v\right)^{12/5}\frac{1}{8(1-c)l\_{1}l\_{2}l\_{3}}=1 |  |

i.e., for example161616Comp. (4.7), (4.8).,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.5) |  | l\_{1}l\_{2}\bar{a}^{2},\ \bar{a}=\left(\frac{4}{\pi}\sin v\right)^{6/5}\left(% \frac{1}{8(1-c)l\_{3}}\right)^{1/2}. |  |

Consequently, we put, for example171717Comp. (1.13) – (1.16).

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.6) |  | F\_{3}=F\_{3}(\bar{a},0),\ F\_{4}=F\_{4}(-\bar{a},0) |  |

and after this we substitute the values

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.7) |  | l\_{1}=|F\_{3}M|,\ l\_{2}=|F\_{4}M| |  |

into (5.2) and we obtain181818Comp. (4.6) – (4.9). the following result.
