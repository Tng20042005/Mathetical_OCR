## 2. Jacob’s ladders: notions and basic geometrical properties

### 2.1.

In this paper we use the following notions of our works [5] – [9]:

* (a)

  Jacob’s ladder \varphi\_{1}(T),
* (b)

  direct iterations of Jacob’s ladders

  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  |  | \begin{split}&\varphi\_{1}^{0}(t)=t,\ \varphi\_{1}^{1}(t)=\varphi\_{1}(t),\ % \varphi\_{1}^{2}(t)=\varphi\_{1}(\varphi\_{1}(t)),\dots,\\ &\varphi\_{1}^{k}(t)=\varphi\_{1}(\varphi\_{1}^{k-1}(t))\end{split} |  |

  for every fixed natural number k,
* (c)

  reverse iterations of Jacob’s ladders

  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (2.1) |  | \begin{split}&\varphi\_{1}^{-1}(T)=\overset{1}{T},\ \varphi\_{1}^{-2}(T)=\varphi% \_{1}^{-1}(\overset{1}{T})=\overset{2}{T},\dots,\\ &\varphi\_{1}^{-r}(T)=\varphi\_{1}^{-1}(\overset{r-1}{T})=\overset{r}{T},\ r=1,% \dots,k,\end{split} |  |

  where, for example,

  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (2.2) |  | \varphi\_{1}(\overset{r}{T})=\overset{r-1}{T} |  |

  for every fixed k\in\mathbb{N} and every sufficiently big T>0. We also use the properties of the reverse iterations listed below.

  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (2.3) |  | \overset{r}{T}-\overset{r-1}{T}\sim(1-c)\pi(\overset{r}{T});\ \pi(\overset{r}{% T})\sim\frac{\overset{r}{T}}{\ln\overset{r}{T}},\ r=1,\dots,k,\ T\to\infty, |  |

  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (2.4) |  | \overset{0}{T}=T<\overset{1}{T}(T)<\overset{2}{T}(T)<\dots<\overset{k}{T}(T), |  |

  and

  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | (2.5) |  | T\sim\overset{1}{T}\sim\overset{2}{T}\sim\dots\sim\overset{k}{T},\ T\to\infty. |  |

###### Remark 4.

The asymptotic behaviour of the points

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \{T,\overset{1}{T},\dots,\overset{k}{T}\} |  |

is as follows: at T\to\infty these points recede unboundedly each from other and all together are receding to infinity. Hence, the set of these points behaves at T\to\infty as one-dimensional Friedmann-Hubble expanding Universe.

### 2.2.

Let us remind that we have proved666See [9], (3.4). the existence of almost linear increments

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.6) |  | \begin{split}&\int\_{\overset{r-1}{T}}^{\overset{r}{T}}\left|\zeta\left(\frac{1% }{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d}t\sim(1-c)\overset{r-1}{T},\\ &r=1,\dots,k,\ T\to\infty,\ \overset{r}{T}=\overset{r}{T}(T)=\varphi\_{1}^{-r}(% T)\end{split} |  |

for the Hardy-Littlewood integral (1918)

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.7) |  | J(T)=\int\_{0}^{T}\left|\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^{2}{\rm d}t. |  |
