### 1.3.

Now, let us put, see (1.5), (1.8),

| (1.9) |  | \begin{split}&\sum\_{T\leq g\_{2\nu}\leq T+U}\int\_{g\_{2\nu}(-v)}^{g\_{2\nu}(v)}Z^% {2}(t){\rm d}t=\int\_{G\_{3}(v)}Z^{2}(t){\rm d}t,\\ &\sum\_{T\leq g\_{2\nu+1}\leq T+U}\int\_{g\_{2\nu+1}(-w)}^{g\_{2\nu+1}(w)}Z^{2}(t){% \rm d}t=\int\_{G\_{4}(w)}Z^{2}(t){\rm d}t.\end{split} |  |

In this paper we use as a basic formula a variant of our formula [3], (16). Namely, we use the following result.

###### Formula 1.

| (1.10) |  | \begin{split}&\int\_{G\_{3}(v)}Z^{2}(t){\rm d}t-\int\_{G\_{4}(w)}Z^{2}(t){\rm d}t=% \\ &\frac{4}{\pi}U\sin v+\mathcal{O}(vT^{5/12}\ln^{3}T)\end{split} |  |

for two continuum systems \{G\_{3}(v)\}, \{G\_{4}(w)\} of disconnected sets with almost equal measures444See [3], (13).:

| (1.11) |  | m[G\_{3}(v)]=m[G\_{4}(w)]+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{v}{\ln T}\right),\ T\to\infty, |  |

where

| (1.12) |  | U=T^{5/12}\ln^{3}T,\ 0<v\leq\frac{\pi}{2}. |  |

###### Remark 1.

That is, we have proved in [3] that there is considerable difference between two basic integrals (1.9), namely there is a big excess of the first one over the other.

### 1.4.

Now, let us remind the lemniscate of Bernoulli. It is the planar locus traced out by a point M that moves in such a way that the product of its distances from two fixed points
