Let C/\mathbb{Q}\_{p} be a complete algebraically closed extension, let A/C be an abelian variety, and let 0\in A(C) be the identity element. If the dimension of A is at least 1, then \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(A^{\mathrm{rig}},0) is not an abelian group.

In particular, in the setting of 1, the natural map \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(A^{\mathrm{rig}},0)\rightarrow\pi\_{1,\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(%
A^{\mathrm{rig}},0) is not injective and thus finite étale coverings do not detect all de Jong coverings. This is in contrast to the complex analytic setting where the topological fundamental group of a complex abelian variety is a finite free \mathbb{Z}-module and thus injects into its profinite completion, the étale fundamental group.

###### Remark 1.

From a classical perspective, an abelian variety having a non-abelian fundamental group is surprising. On the other hand, it is perhaps not as surprising as the non-triviality (and worse… [Howe.ThedeJongFundamentalGroupOfP1C])) of the fundamental group of \mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}\_{C} furnished already by the covers of 1, and we use these covers in our proof of 1.

For n=\dim A, we establish 1 by pulling back the cover of \mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C} in 1 along a generically étale map A\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C} and then using geometric Sen theory to show the monodromy of this pullback remains non-abelian. The proof also implies that the monodromy is infinite, an observation we first learned from Sasha Petrov.

###### Question 1.

This method of proof does not work for a general abeloid variety A/C — indeed, such an A may not admit *any* rational functions, in which case the covers of 1 cannot be used to produce any candidate non-abelian covers of A. It is thus natural to ask: is the de Jong fundamental group of a non-trivial abeloid non-abelian? We note that, for A/C abeloid, the usual profinite étale fundamental group is “as expected,” i.e. equal to T\_{\hat{\mathbb{Z}}}A (see [BellovinCaiHowe.CharacterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties, Appendix A]).

The key ingredients in the proof of 1 are the injectivity of the geometric Sen morphism for the Lubin-Tate tower (2, which follows from a computation of the geometric Sen morphism given in [DospinescuRodriguezCamargo.JacquetLanglands]), and the observation that, if the monodromy is abelian, then the geometric Sen morphism is constant (3). We treat these preliminaries in 2 and then use them to prove 1 in 3.

###### Remark 2.

Our proof does not use the surjectivity of 1; all that is needed is the pointwise injectivity of the associated geometric Sen morphism (a “softer” fact than the actual monodromy computation for 1).

We thank Rebecca Bellovin, Hanlin Cai, and Ben Heuer for helpful discussions about profinite étale covers of abelian varieties around [BellovinCaiHowe.CharacterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties]. We thank Sasha Petrov for helpful comments on an earlier draft and for pointing out to us that the geometric Sen morphism can be used to show that, for X/C a connected rigid variety, x\in X(C), and f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C} a map that is not locally constant, the image of \rho\_{n}\circ f\_{\*}:\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(X,x)\rightarrow\mathrm{SL}\_{n+1}(%
\mathbb{Q}\_{p}) must contain an infinite closed subgroup; this inspired our proof of 1. This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation grants DMS-2201112 and DMS-2501816.

## 2. Preliminaries

In this section we establish the technical results needed in the proof of 1.

### 2.1. The geometric Sen morphism and its functoriality

Recall from [2, Theorem 1.0.4] that, for X/C a smooth rigid analytic variety and K a p-adic Lie group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{k}, any pro-étale K-torsor \tilde{X}/X gives rise to a geometric Sen morphism

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \theta\_{\tilde{X}}\in\left(\Omega^{1}\_{X/C}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}}\left(\tilde{% \mathfrak{k}}\otimes\_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}{\widehat{\mathcal{O}}}(-1)% \right)\right)(X), |  |

where \tilde{\mathfrak{k}}=\tilde{X}\times^{K}\underline{\mathfrak{k}} is the twisted form of the constant local system \underline{\mathfrak{k}} associated to \tilde{X} and the adjoint action of K on \mathfrak{k}. Dually, we view this as a morphism on X\_{\mathrm{pro\acute{e}t}},
