We recall also from the statement of [2, Theorem 1.0.4] that \kappa\_{\tilde{X}} is natural for pullbacks and push-outs of torsors:

###### Lemma 1 (Functoriality of \kappa).

Let K be a p-adic Lie group.

1. (1)

   If f:X\rightarrow Y is a map of smooth rigid analytic varieties over C and \tilde{Y}/Y is a pro-étale K-torsor, then \kappa\_{f^{\*}\tilde{Y}}=f^{\*}\kappa\_{\tilde{X}}\circ df, where df:T\_{X/C}\rightarrow\pi^{\*}T\_{Y/C}
   is the derivative of f.
2. (2)

   If H is a p-adic Lie group and \rho:H\rightarrow K is a continuous homomorphism, then for any smooth rigid analytic variety X/C and pro-étale H-torsor \tilde{X}/X,
   \kappa\_{\tilde{X}\times^{\rho}\underline{H}}=d\rho\circ\kappa\_{\tilde{X}}, where \mathfrak{h}:=\mathrm{Lie}H and d\rho:\mathfrak{h}\rightarrow\mathfrak{k}
   is the derivative.

### 2.2. Representations of the de Jong fundamental group

Suppose X/C is a smooth connected rigid analytic variety and x\in X(C). If K is a p-adic Lie group and \rho:\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(X,x)\rightarrow K is a continous homomorphism, then the discrete \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(X,x)-sets K/U, as U-varies over open subgroups of K, give rise to a tower \tilde{X}\_{\rho}=(X\_{K/U,\rho})\_{U} of étale covers of X. Viewed as an object of X\_{\mathrm{pro\acute{e}t}}, \tilde{X}\_{\rho} is a K-torsor. In this case, we write \kappa\_{\rho}=\kappa\_{\tilde{X}\_{\rho}} for the associated geometric Sen morphism.

In particular, we can apply this to the \rho\_{n} of 1, whose associated torsor is a geometric connected component of the infinite level Lubin-Tate tower.

###### Lemma 2.

For \rho\_{n} as in 1, the geometric Sen morphism \kappa\_{\rho\_{n}} is an injection at every geometric point.

###### Proof.

By 1-(2), it suffices to treat \rho\_{n} as a map to \mathrm{GL}\_{n+1}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p}). We note that over \mathbb{P}^{n} we have a universal filtration on the trivial \mathrm{GL}\_{n+1}-torsor and thus, via the adjoint representation, a filtration on \mathfrak{gl}\_{n+1}\otimes\_{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}. We also have the Hodge-Tate filtration on \tilde{\mathfrak{gl}}\_{n+1}\otimes\_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}. As a specific case of the computation given for local Shimura varieties in [DospinescuRodriguezCamargo.JacquetLanglands, §4.3], \kappa\_{\rho\_{n}} is then canonically identified with the map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T\_{\mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C}}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}=\mathrm{gr}^{-1}\_% {\mathrm{univ}}\left(\mathfrak{gl}\_{n+1}\otimes\_{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}\hat{\mathcal{% O}}\right)=\mathrm{gr}^{1}\_{\mathrm{HT}}\left(\tilde{\mathfrak{gl}}\_{n+1}% \otimes\_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}\right)(-1) |  |

where the second equality is the Hodge-Tate comparison and we note that, because the filtrations are minuscule, the last term is equal to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathrm{Fil}^{1}\_{\mathrm{HT}}\left(\tilde{\mathfrak{gl}}\_{n+1}\otimes\_{% \underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}\right)(-1)\subseteq\tilde{% \mathfrak{gl}}\_{n+1}\otimes\_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}(-1). |  |

Alternatively, this computation follows from a more general computation relating the geometric Sen and Kodaira-Spencer morphisms for de Rham torsors [Howe.GeometricSenAndKodairaSpencer]. Indeed, this \mathrm{GL}\_{n+1}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p})-torsor is the base change to C of a de Rham \mathrm{GL}\_{n+1}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p}) torsor on \mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}\_{\breve{\mathbb{Q}}\_{p}} whose associated filtered \mathrm{GL}\_{n+1}-torsor with integrable connection is, by construction, the trivial torsor with the trivial connection and universal filtration.
