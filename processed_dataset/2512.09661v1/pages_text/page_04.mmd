### 2.3. Abelian torsors

If H is an abelian p-adic Lie group with Lie algebra \mathfrak{h}, then the adjoint action on \mathfrak{h} is trivial. In particular, if X/C is a smooth rigid analytic variety and \tilde{X}/X is an H-torsor, \tilde{\mathfrak{h}} is simply the constant local system \underline{\mathfrak{h}} and

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2) |  | \kappa\_{\tilde{X}}\in\mathrm{Hom}(T\_{X/C}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}}\hat{\mathcal{O}% },\mathfrak{h}\otimes\_{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}(-1))=H^{0}(X,\Omega\_{X% /C})\otimes\_{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}\mathfrak{h}(-1). |  |

In particular, when X is an abelian variety, we immediately obtain:

###### Lemma 3.

Suppose A/C is an abelian variety, H is an abelian p-adic Lie group, and \tilde{A}/A is a pro-étale H-torsor. Then, the geometric Sen morphism

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \kappa\_{\tilde{A}}:\mathrm{Lie}A\otimes\_{C}\hat{\mathcal{O}}=T\_{A/C}\otimes\_{% \mathcal{O}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}\otimes\_{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}% \hat{\mathcal{O}}(-1) |  |

is constant, i.e., it is induced by the base change from C to \hat{\mathcal{O}} of a C-linear map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathrm{Lie}A\rightarrow\mathfrak{h}\otimes\_{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}C(-1). |  |

###### Remark 3.

The simplification in the case of abelian covers as in 2 was observed already in [BellovinCaiHowe.CharacterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties] where, in particular, we computed the geometric Sen morphism for all profinite étale torsors over abelian varieties (which are necessarily abelian).

## 3. Proof of 1

We now prove 1.

###### Proof of 1.

Let n=\dim A. We may choose an embedding of A into \mathbb{P}^{m}\_{C}, m>n, and then project onto a generic n-plane \mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C}\subseteq\mathbb{P}^{m}\_{C} to obtain a generically étale map f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C}. We claim that the pullback of the \mathrm{SL}\_{n+1}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p})-torsor associated to f has non-abelian monodromy, i.e., \rho\_{n}\circ f\_{\*} has non-abelian image, where f\_{\*}:\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(A^{\mathrm{rig}},0)\rightarrow\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(%
\mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}\_{C},\pi(0)) is the map induced by f.

To see this, first observe that the map f is proper as A/C is proper and \mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C}/C is separated. Thus f cannot be étale since \mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C} has no non-trivial connected finite étale covers. Thus df is not an isomorphism, so there exists a nonzero vector v\in\mathrm{Lie}A=H^{0}(A,T\_{A/C}) and a point x\in A(C) such that df\_{x}(v)=0, where df\_{x} is the derivative at that point, a map of finite dimensional C-vector spaces T\_{A/C,x}\rightarrow T\_{\mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C}/C,f(x)}. Since f is generically étale, there also exists a point y\in A(C) such that df\_{y}(v)\neq 0.

Now, suppose \rho\_{n}\circ\pi\_{\*} has abelian image, and write H\leq\mathrm{SL}\_{n}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p}) for the (abelian) closure of its image, a p-adic Lie group. Write \mathfrak{h}:=\mathrm{Lie}H, and write \rho for the induced map \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(A^{\mathrm{rig}},0)\rightarrow H. Then, by 3, \kappa\_{\rho} is a constant map. Thus it cannot annihilate the vector v\in\mathrm{Lie}A at one point but not another. However, for \iota:H\rightarrow\mathrm{SL}\_{n+1}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p}) the inclusion, the functorialities of 1 give

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d\iota\circ\kappa\_{\rho}=\kappa\_{\rho\_{n}\circ\pi\_{\*}}=\pi^{\*}\kappa\_{\rho\_{n}% }\circ d\pi |  |

In particular, since d\iota and \pi^{\*}\kappa\_{\rho\_{n}} are injective at every geometric point (the latter by 2), the kernels of \kappa\_{\rho} and d\pi agree at every geometric point. Thus we obtain a contradiction since v is in the kernel of d\pi\_{x} but not in the kernel of d\pi\_{y}.
