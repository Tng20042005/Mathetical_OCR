## 1. Introduction

Let C be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. If A/C is an abelian variety and 0\in A(C) is the identity element, then the étale fundamental group \pi\_{1,\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(A,0) is identified with T\_{\hat{\mathbb{Z}}}A=\varprojlim\_{n}A[n](C) by its translation action on the universal profinite étale cover \tilde{A}=\varprojlim\_{n}A (in both limits the indices are positive integers ordered by divisibility, and the transition map for m|n is multiplication by n/m). If C is a complete algebraically closed extension of \mathbb{Q}\_{p}, then we can also pass to the associated rigid analytic space A^{\mathrm{rig}}/C. Its category of finite étale covers is equivalent to the category of finite étale covers of A, so that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \pi\_{1,\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(A^{\mathrm{rig}},0)=\pi\_{1,\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(A,% 0)=T\_{\hat{\mathbb{Z}}}A. |  |

In particular, \pi\_{1,\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(A^{\mathrm{rig}},0) is an abelian group.

However, in the rigid analytic setting, there are more general notions of covering spaces that mix properties of topological and finite étale coverings. One such notion is that of de Jong coverings as introduced in [1], and there is an associated de Jong fundamental group \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(A^{\mathrm{rig}},0), a pro-discrete topological group whose continuous actions on discrete sets correspond to de Jong coverings of A^{\mathrm{rig}}. It is well known that de Jong fundamental groups can be much larger than classical étale fundamental groups: for example, although \pi\_{1,\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(\mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}\_{C})=\pi\_{1,\mathrm{%
\acute{e}t}}(\mathbb{P}^{n}\_{C})=\{1\}, for n\geq 1 the de Jong fundamental group \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}\_{C}) is large: a connected component over C of the height n+1 Lubin-Tate tower furnishes, via the Gross-Hopkins period map, a tower of connected de Jong coverings of \mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}\_{C}. For y\in\mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}(C), this tower is classified by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1) |  | \rho\_{n}:\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{n,\mathrm{rig}}\_{C},y)\rightarrow% \mathrm{SL}\_{n+1}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p}), |  |

and this map is a surjection by [1, Proposition 7.4].

For abelian varieties over C of bad reduction, there are well-known connected de Jong coverings with infinite discrete fibers coming from Raynaud uniformization. These are all abelian and, moreover, the associated covering groups are free \mathbb{Z}-modules of finite rank so that, up to profinite completion, these covers are detected already by the classical étale fundamental group. The main point of this note is that there are abundant de Jong covers beyond this construction. In particular:
