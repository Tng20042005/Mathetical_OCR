###### Abstract.

We demonstrate quasi-isometric rigidity for the product of a non-uniform rank one lattice and a nilpotent lattice. Specifically, we show that any finitely-generated group quasi-isometric to such a product is, up to finite noise, an extension of a non-uniform rank one lattice by a nilpotent lattice. Furthermore, we show under extra conditions that this extension is nilcentral, a notion which generalizes central extensions to extensions by a nilpotent group.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background

One theme of geometric group theory is the rich relationship between the algebraic structure of groups and the large-scale geometry of spaces on which they act. By the “large-scale geometry” of a space we mean the metric structure that is preserved by quasi-isometries, maps which preserve distances up to a controlled error. Gromov proposed in a 1983 ICM address [GRO83] a broad research program of studying finitely generated groups as geometric objects and classifying them up to quasi-isometry. One aspect involves identifying instances of quasi-isometric rigidity, the phenomenon which occurs when algebraic properties of a finitely generated group are determined by its large-scale geometry. For example, a celebrated theorem by Gromov [GRO81] states that finitely generated groups of polynomial growth are virtually nilpotent (the converse is also true [WOL68]). Since growth rate is invariant under quasi-isometry, it follows that any finitely generated group which is quasi-isometric to a space of polynomial growth necessarily has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. Thus we have an instance of when the quasi-isometry type of a group determines some of its algebraic structure.

One of the landmark results in research on quasi-isometric rigidity is the complete quasi-isometry classification of lattices in semisimple Lie groups. A large body of work in the 1980s and 1990s by several people over many papers culminated in a general theorem on the rigidity of the class of lattices among all finitely generated groups (see [FAR97] for a detailed survey). Informally, this theorem states that any group quasi-isometric to a lattice in a semisimple Lie group is almost a lattice in that Lie group. More precisely,

###### Theorem 1 (Rigidity of lattices).

If \Gamma is a finitely generated group quasi-isometric to an irreducible lattice in a semisimple Lie group G, then there is a short exact sequence

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \tikzcd 1\rightarrow[r]&F\rightarrow[r]\Gamma\rightarrow[r]\Lambda\rightarrow[% r]1 |  |

where \Lambda is a lattice in G, and F is a finite group.

One of the major breakthroughs leading to this general classification was the work of Schwartz [SCH95] on non-uniform lattices in rank one semisimple Lie groups. These Lie groups agree, up to index 2, with the isometry groups of the negatively curved symmetric spaces: real, complex, quaternionic hyperbolic space, and the Cayley hyperbolic plane.

###### Theorem 2 (Schwartz).

Let X be a negatively curved symmetric space other than the real hyperbolic plane \mathbb{H}^{2}. If \Gamma is a finitely generated group quasi-isometric to a non-uniform lattice \Lambda in \textup{Isom}({X}), then there exists a short exact sequence

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \tikzcd 1\rightarrow[r]&F\rightarrow[r]\Gamma\rightarrow[r]\Lambda^{\prime}% \rightarrow[r]1. |  |

where \Lambda^{\prime}\leq\textup{Isom}({X}) is a non-uniform lattice commensurable to \Lambda, and F is a finite group.
