###### Proof.

Fix i\in\left\{{0,\dots,n}\right\}. By Proposition 26 it suffices to show that \Gamma/Z\_{i} has a finite-index subgroup K\_{i} containing N/Z\_{i} in which Z(N/Z\_{i}) is central. Since N/Z\_{i} is normal in \Gamma/Z\_{i} and Z(N/Z\_{i}) is characteristic in N/Z\_{i}, we have Z(N/Z\_{i})\lhd\Gamma/Z\_{i}. So \Gamma/Z\_{i} acts by conjugation on Z(N/Z\_{i}), and we call this action \rho\_{1}. If \rho\_{1}:\Gamma/Z\_{i}\to\text{Aut}(Z(N/Z\_{i})) has finite image, then we may take K\_{i}=\ker\rho\_{1} to finish. Since N/Z\_{i}\leq\ker\rho\_{1}, we may project \rho\_{1} to an action \rho\_{2} of \Delta=(\Gamma/Z\_{i})/(N/Z\_{i}) on Z(N/Z\_{i}). Then it suffices to show that \rho\_{2}:\Delta\to\text{Aut}(Z(N/Z\_{i})) has finite image because \text{im }\rho\_{2}=\text{im }\rho\_{1}.

Recall that Z(N/Z\_{i})=\mathbb{Z}^{d} for some d\leq r. So \text{Aut}(Z(N/Z\_{i}))=\text{GL}(d,\mathbb{Z}), and the latter group naturally embeds into \text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R}). Composing \rho\_{2} with this inclusion yields a homomorphism \rho\_{3}:\Delta\to\text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R}), and it suffices to show that \rho\_{3} has bounded image. From (5), \Delta is finitely generated because F is finite and the lattice \Lambda is finitely generated. Thus by Selberg’s lemma, \rho\_{3}(\Delta) has a finite-index subgroup which is torsion-free. This subgroup has pre-image \Delta^{\prime}\leq\Delta which also has finite index. Let \rho\_{4}:\Delta^{\prime}\to\text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R}) be the restriction \rho\_{3}|\_{\Delta^{\prime}}, and note that since [\Delta:\Delta^{\prime}]<\infty, it suffices to show that \rho\_{4} has bounded image. Since \rho\_{4}(\Delta^{\prime}) is torsion-free and F is finite, we have that \Delta^{\prime}\cap F\subset\ker\rho\_{4}. So \rho\_{4} projects to a homomorphism \rho\_{5}:\Delta^{\prime}/(\Delta^{\prime}\cap F)\to\text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R}). Since \text{im}\ \rho\_{5}=\text{im}\ \rho\_{4}, it suffices to show that \rho\_{5} has bounded image.

Now, \Delta^{\prime}/(\Delta^{\prime}\cap F) is isomorphic to (\Delta^{\prime}F)/F, and since \Delta^{\prime} has finite index in \Delta, (\Delta^{\prime}F)/F has finite index in \Delta/F=\Lambda. Thus, \Delta^{\prime}/(\Delta^{\prime}\cap F) is a lattice in \text{Isom}(X). The hypothesis on X implies \text{Isom}(X) has property (T). Hence, we may apply Theorem 24 to \rho\_{5} to obtain representations \pi\_{1}:\text{Isom}(X)\to\text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R}) and \pi\_{2}:\Delta^{\prime}/(\Delta^{\prime}\cap F)\to\text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R}), where \pi\_{2} has bounded image, such that \rho\_{5}(\gamma)=\pi\_{1}(\gamma)\pi\_{2}(\gamma) for \gamma\in\Delta^{\prime}/(\Delta^{\prime}\cap F). If \dim\text{Isom}(X)>\Sigma(N)\geq d, so that the simple group \text{Isom}(X) has larger dimension than \text{GL}(d,\mathbb{R}), then \pi\_{1} must be trivial, in which case \rho\_{5}=\pi\_{2} has bounded image.
