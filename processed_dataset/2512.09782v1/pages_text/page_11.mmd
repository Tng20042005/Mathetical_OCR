Fix \gamma\in\ker\theta. Then \theta(\gamma)=\text{id}\_{X} and so d\_{X}(\psi(\gamma)(b),b)\leq\beta for all b\in B. By Lemma 8, there exists \delta^{\prime}>0 so that in B, every d\_{X}-ball of radius \beta is contained in a d\_{B}-ball of radius \delta^{\prime}. Then d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma)(b),b)\leq\delta^{\prime} for all b\in B. Take a fiber F=\left\{{b\_{0}}\right\}\times N\subset B\times N and let x\in F. Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma)(x)],b\_{0}) | \displaystyle\leq d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma)(x)],\psi(\gamma)(\pi[x]))+d\_{B}(\psi(% \gamma)(b\_{0}),b\_{0})\leq D+\delta^{\prime}. |  |

Set \delta=D+\delta^{\prime} and note that this value does not depend on the choice of \gamma. Then observe that d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma)(x)],b\_{0})\leq\delta if and only if h(\gamma)(x)\in N\_{\delta}(F).
∎

Fix a fiber F\_{0}=\left\{{b\_{0}}\right\}\times N\subset B\times N. For \gamma\in\ker\theta and x\in F\_{0}, Lemma 18 guarantees that there exists a point f(\gamma)(x) in F\_{0} such that d(f(\gamma)(x),h(\gamma)(x))\leq\delta. So for each \gamma\in\ker\theta we have a map f(\gamma):F\_{0}\to F\_{0}.

###### Proposition 19.

The map \gamma\mapsto f(\gamma) is a cobounded quasi-action of \ker\theta on F\_{0}.

###### Proof.

First we show that f(\gamma) is a quasi-isometry.
Fix \gamma\in\ker\theta, and let x,y\in F\_{0}. Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d(f(\gamma)(x),f(\gamma)(y)) | \displaystyle\leq d(h(\gamma)(x),h(\gamma)(y))+2\delta |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq kd(x,y)+k+2\delta |  |

and

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d(f(\gamma)(x),f(\gamma)(y)) | \displaystyle\geq d(h(\gamma)(x),h(\gamma)(y))-2\delta |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq\frac{1}{k}d(x,y)-k-2\delta |  |

Let z\in F\_{0}. Since h(\gamma) has k-dense image, there is some y=(b,n)\in B\times N for which d(z,h(\gamma)(y))\leq k. By Lemma 18, d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma)(y)],b)\leq\delta. So it turns out that b cannot be too far from b\_{0}. Indeed,
