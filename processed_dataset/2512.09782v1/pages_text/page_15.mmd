but (ca,-1)=(ac^{-1},-1)=(c^{-1}a,-1) if and only if c=c^{-1}, which is not the case. Thus c\in Z(N), but (c,1)\notin Z(G).

Let

| (3) |  | \tikzcd 1\rightarrow[r]&N\rightarrow[r,"j"]G\rightarrow[r]H\rightarrow[r]1 |  |

be a short exact sequence of groups, where N is nilpotent. We say that (3) is a nilcentral extension if j(N) is nilcentral in G. Note that an abelian extension is nilcentral if and only if it is central. Our theorem at the end of the section provides a family of non-trivial examples of nilpotent extensions that are nilcentral. On the other hand, if \varphi:H\to\text{Aut}(N) is as in Example 25, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \tikzcd 1\rightarrow[r]&N\rightarrow[r]N\rtimes\_{\varphi}H\rightarrow[r]H% \rightarrow[r]1 |  |

is a nilpotent extension which is not nilcentral.

We will see that in the situation of Theorem A under some additional conditions, passing to a finite-index subgroup of \Gamma^{\prime} does yield a nilcentral extension. To this end, we make the following definition. We say that (3) is a virtually nilcentral extension if G has a finite-index subgroup G^{\prime} containing j(N) such that j(N) is nilcentral in G^{\prime}. Recall that this means Z(N/Z\_{i})\subseteq Z(G^{\prime}/Z\_{i}) for i=0,\dots,n, where N is identified with j(N)\subseteq G. We now give a more tractable characterization of virtually nilcentral extensions.

###### Proposition 26.

The short exact sequence (3) is a virtually nilcentral extension if and only if for each i=0,\dots,n, G/Z\_{i} has a finite-index subgroup K\_{i} containing N/Z\_{i}, such that Z(N/Z\_{i})\subseteq Z(K\_{i}).

###### Proof.

The forward direction is done by taking K\_{i}=G^{\prime}/Z\_{i} for each i. For the reverse direction, recall that K\_{i}=G\_{i}/Z\_{i} for some G\_{i}\leq G. So N\leq G\_{i} and [G:G\_{i}]=[G/Z\_{i}:K\_{i}]<\infty. Let G^{\prime}=\bigcap G\_{i}. Since each G\_{i} has finite index, so does G^{\prime}. For each i, N/Z\_{i}\subset G^{\prime}/Z\_{i}\subset K\_{i}, and since Z(N/Z\_{i})\subset Z(K\_{i}), we have Z(N/Z\_{i})\subset Z(G^{\prime}/Z\_{i}).
∎

Now suppose we are in the situation of Theorem A and we have the following two short exact sequences.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4) |  | \tikzcd 1\rightarrow[r]&N\rightarrow[r]\Gamma\rightarrow[r]\Delta\rightarrow[r]1 |  |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5) |  | \tikzcd 1\rightarrow[r]&F\rightarrow[r]\Delta\rightarrow[r]\Lambda\rightarrow[% r]1 |  |

where N is a nilpotent lattice (we are now using N to denote the lattice, not the ambient Lie group), F is finite, and \Lambda is a non-uniform lattice in \text{Isom}(X), where X\neq\mathbb{H}^{2} is a negatively curved symmetric space. Since N is finitely generated, nilpotent, and torsion-free, Z(N/Z\_{i})=Z\_{i+1}/Z\_{i} is a finitely generated free abelian group. That is, Z(N/Z\_{i})=\mathbb{Z}^{d\_{i}} for some d\_{i}, and so \Sigma(N)=\max\_{i}d\_{i}. We now focus on the situation when X is quaternionic hyperbolic space or the Cayley hyperbolic plane, and \text{Isom}(X) has sufficiently large dimension.

###### Theorem 27.

Suppose X is either quaternionic hyperbolic space or the Cayley hyperbolic plane. If \dim\textup{Isom}(X)>\Sigma(N), then (4) is a virtually nilcentral extension.
