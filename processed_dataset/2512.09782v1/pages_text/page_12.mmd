|  |  | \displaystyle\leq d(z,h(\gamma)(x))+\delta |  |

Set x=(b\_{0},n). Then d(x,y)=d\_{B}(b\_{0},b)\leq k+\delta, and so

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d(z,f(\gamma)(x)) | \displaystyle\leq d(z,h(\gamma)(y))+d(h(\gamma)(y),h(\gamma)(x))+d(h(\gamma)(x% ),f(\gamma)(x)) |  |
|  |  |  |  |

|  |  | \displaystyle\leq k+(kd(x,y)+k)+\delta |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq k+k(k+\delta)+k+\delta. |  |

It follows that f(\gamma) is a quasi-isometry.

For all x\in F\_{0},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d(f(1)(x),x)\leq d(f(1)(x),h(1)(x))+d(h(1)(x),x)\leq\delta+k. |  |

Let \gamma\_{1},\gamma\_{2}\in\Gamma and x\in F\_{0}. Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d(f(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(x),f(\gamma\_{1})f(\gamma\_{2})(x)) | \displaystyle\leq d(f(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(x),h(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(x))+d(h% (\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(x),f(\gamma\_{1})f(\gamma\_{2})(x)) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\delta+d(h(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(x),h(\gamma\_{1})h(\gamma\_{2}% )(x)) |  |

|  |  | \displaystyle\qquad+d(h(\gamma\_{1})h(\gamma\_{2})(x),f(\gamma\_{1})f(\gamma\_{2})% (x)) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\delta+k+d(h(\gamma\_{1})h(\gamma\_{2})(x),h(\gamma\_{1})f(% \gamma\_{2})(x)) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\qquad+d(h(\gamma\_{1})f(\gamma\_{2})(x),f(\gamma\_{1})f(\gamma\_{2})% (x)) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\delta+k+[kd(h(\gamma\_{2})(x),f(\gamma\_{2})(x))+k]+\delta |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\delta+k+k\delta+k+\delta. |  |

It follows that f is a quasi-action, and it remains to show that f is cobounded.

Recall that it suffices to show that the orbit of x\_{0}=(b\_{0},e)\in F\_{0} is r-dense in F\_{0} for some r>0. First we claim that if \gamma\in\Gamma is such that h(\gamma)(x\_{0})\in N\_{k}(F\_{0}), then \theta(\gamma) moves b\_{0} by a distance which is bounded independently of \gamma. Indeed, if h(\gamma)(x\_{0})\in N\_{k}(F\_{0}) then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d\_{X}(\theta(\gamma)(b\_{0}),b\_{0}) | \displaystyle\leq d\_{X}(\theta(\gamma)(b\_{0}),\psi(\gamma)(b\_{0}))+d\_{B}(\psi(% \gamma)(\pi[x\_{0}]),\pi[h(\gamma)(x\_{0})])+d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma)(x\_{0})],\pi[x\_{% 0}]) |  |
|  |  |  |  |

|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\beta+D+k. |  |
