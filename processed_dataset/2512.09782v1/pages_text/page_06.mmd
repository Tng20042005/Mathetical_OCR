Let \gamma\_{1},\gamma\_{2}\in\Gamma and b\in B. Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma\_{1})\psi(\gamma\_{2})(b),\psi(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_% {2})(b)) | \displaystyle\leq d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma\_{1})\psi(\gamma\_{2})(b),\pi[h(\gamma\_{1})h% (\gamma\_{2})(b,e)]) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\qquad+d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma\_{1})h(\gamma\_{2})(b,e)],\pi[h(\gamma\_{1% }\gamma\_{2})(b,e)]) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\qquad+d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(b,e)],\psi(\gamma\_{1}% \gamma\_{2})(b)). |  |

The first term on the right can be bounded as follows.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma\_{1})\psi(\gamma\_{2})(b),\pi[h(\gamma\_{1})h(% \gamma\_{2})(b,e)]) | \displaystyle\leq d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma\_{1})\psi(\gamma\_{2})(b),\psi(\gamma\_{1})(% \pi[h(\gamma\_{2})(b,e)])) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\qquad+d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma\_{1})(\pi[h(\gamma\_{2})(b,e)]),\pi[h(% \gamma\_{1})h(\gamma\_{2})(b,e)]) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq k^{\prime}d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma\_{2})(b),\pi[h(\gamma\_{2})(b,e)])% +k^{\prime}+D |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq k^{\prime}D+k^{\prime}+D. |  |

Hence,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma\_{1})\psi(\gamma\_{2})(b),\psi(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_% {2})(b)) | \displaystyle\leq(k^{\prime}D+k^{\prime}+D)+d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma\_{1})h(\gamma\_{2% })(b,e)],\pi[h(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(b,e)]) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\qquad+d\_{B}(\pi[h(\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(b,e)],\psi(\gamma\_{1}% \gamma\_{2})(b)) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq k^{\prime}D+k^{\prime}+D+d(h(\gamma\_{1})h(\gamma\_{2})(b,e),h% (\gamma\_{1}\gamma\_{2})(b,e))+D |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq k^{\prime}D+k^{\prime}+2D+k. |  |

Set K=k^{\prime}D+k^{\prime}+2D+k. So \psi is a K-quasi-action. Let b\_{1},b\_{2}\in B. Since h is k-cobounded, there exists \gamma\in\Gamma such that d\_{B}(h(\gamma)(b\_{1},e),(b\_{2},e))\leq k. Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma)(b\_{1}),b\_{2}) | \displaystyle\leq d\_{B}(\psi(\gamma)(b\_{1}),\pi[h(\gamma)(b\_{1},e)])+d\_{B}(\pi% [h(\gamma)(b\_{1},e)],\pi[(b\_{2},e)]) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq D+d(h(\gamma)(b\_{1},e),(b\_{2},e)) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq D+k. |  |

So by possibly increasing K, it follows that \psi is K-cobounded.

∎

Next we show that the quasi-action \psi induces a homomorphism \Gamma\to\text{Isom}(X). It is proved in [SCH95] that the quasi-isometry \psi(\gamma) of B coarsely extends to an isometry of X. More precisely, for each \gamma\in\Gamma there exists \beta>0 and \theta(\gamma)\in\text{Isom}(X) such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2) |  | \displaystyle d\_{X}(\psi(\gamma)(b),\theta(\gamma)(b))\leq\beta |  |
