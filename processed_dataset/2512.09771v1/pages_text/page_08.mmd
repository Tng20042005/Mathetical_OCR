{3}t)-I\_{2}(\lambda\_{% 3}t)\big{|}\,dt |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle=\varepsilon\Bigg{(}\frac{X^{\frac{3}{2}}}{e^{(\log X)^{1/6}}}+J\_% {1}+J\_{2}\Bigg{)}\,, |  | (19) |

say. Using Cauchy’s inequality, Lemma 2, Lemma 3 and Lemma 6, we get

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle J\_{1} | \displaystyle\ll X\Bigg{(}\int\limits\_{-\Delta}^{\Delta}\big{|}S\_{1}(\lambda\_{% 1}t)\big{|}^{2}\,dt\Bigg{)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\Bigg{(}\int\limits\_{-\Delta}^{\Delta% }\big{|}\Sigma(\lambda\_{3}t)-U(\lambda\_{3}t)\big{|}^{2}\,dt\Bigg{)}^{\frac{1}{% 2}}\ll\frac{X^{\frac{3}{2}}}{e^{(\log X)^{1/6}}}\,. |  | (20) |

By Euler’s summation formula, we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | I\_{2}(t)-U(t)\ll 1+|t|X\,. |  | (21) |

From (21), Cauchy’s inequality and Lemma 3, we derive

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle J\_{2} | \displaystyle\ll(1+\Delta X)\Bigg{(}\int\limits\_{-\Delta}^{\Delta}\big{|}S\_{1}% (\lambda\_{1}t)\big{|}^{2}\,dt\Bigg{)}^{\frac{1}{2}}\Bigg{(}\int\limits\_{-% \Delta}^{\Delta}\big{|}S\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t)\big{|}^{2}\,dt\Bigg{)}^{\frac{1}{2}% }\ll\Delta X^{2}\log^{3}X\,. |  | (22) |

On the other hand for the integral defined by (18), we write

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | J(X)=B(X)+\Phi\,, |  | (23) |

where

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | B(X)=\gamma^{3}\int\limits\_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Theta(t)I\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t)I\_{1}% (\lambda\_{2}t)I\_{2}(\lambda\_{3}t)e(\eta t)\,dt\,. |  |

and

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Phi\ll\int\limits\_{\Delta}^{\infty}|\Theta(t)||I\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t)I\_{1}(% \lambda\_{2}t)I\_{2}(\lambda\_{3}t)|\,dt\,. |  | (24) |

Arguing as in ([3], Lemma 4), we deduce that if

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{0}<\min\bigg{(}\dfrac{\lambda\_{1}}{4|\lambda\_{3}|}\,,\dfrac{\lambda\_{% 2}}{4|\lambda\_{3}|}\,,\dfrac{1}{16}\bigg{)} |  |

then
