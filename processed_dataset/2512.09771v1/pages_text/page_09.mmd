By (LABEL:Ik) and ([17], Lemma 4.2), we get

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | I\_{k}(t)\ll X^{\frac{1}{k}-1}\min\Big{(}X,\,|t|^{-1}\Big{)}\,. |  | (26) |

Using (24), (26) and Lemma 1, we obtain

|  |  |  |  |

|  | \Phi\ll\frac{\varepsilon X^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta}\,. |  | (27) |

Bearing in mind (LABEL:Delta), (LABEL:Gamma1-JX), (20), (22), (23), (25) and (27), we establish

|  |  |  |  |

|  | \Gamma\_{1}(X)\gg\varepsilon X^{\frac{3}{2}}\,. |  | (28) |

|  | \mathfrak{S}(t,X)=\min\Big{\{}\big{|}S\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t)\big{|},\big{|}S\_{1}(% \lambda\_{2}t)\big{|}\Big{\}}\,. |  | (29) |

Taking into account (LABEL:Gamma2), (29), Lemma 1 and Lemma 7, we deduce

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Gamma\_{2}(X\_{j}) | \displaystyle\ll\varepsilon\int\limits\_{\Delta\leq|t|\leq H}\mathfrak{S}(t,X\_{% j})^{\frac{1}{2}}\big{|}S\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t)\big{|}^{\frac{1}{2}}\big{|}S\_{1}(% \lambda\_{2}t)\big{|}\big{|}S\_{2}(\lambda\_{3}t)\big{|}\,dt |  |
|  |  |  |  |
