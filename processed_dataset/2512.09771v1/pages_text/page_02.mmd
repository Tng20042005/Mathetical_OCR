Another interesting question is the study of Diophantine inequalities involving special prime numbers.
Let P\_{l} is a number with at most l prime factors.
Very recently Todorova and Georgieva [18] solved inequality (2) with prime numbers p\_{1},\,p\_{2},\,p\_{3} such that p\_{i}+2=P\_{l\_{i}}, i=1,\,2,\,3.
In 1953, Piatetski-Shapiro [13] has shown that for any fixed \frac{11}{12}<\gamma<1, there exist infinitely many prime numbers of the form p=[n^{1/\gamma}].
Such primes are called Piatetski-Shapiro primes of type \gamma.
Subsequently, the interval for \gamma was sharpened many times and the best result to date has been supplied by Rivat and Wu [16] with \frac{205}{243}<\gamma<1.
In 2022, the author [4] proved that for any fixed \frac{37}{38}<\gamma<1, the inequality (1) is solvable with infinitely many Piatetski-Shapiro prime triples p\_{1},\,p\_{2},\,p\_{3} of type \gamma.
As a continuation of these studies, we solve (2) with Piatetski-Shapiro primes.

###### Theorem 1.

Suppose that \lambda\_{1},\lambda\_{2},\lambda\_{3} are nonzero real numbers, not all of the same sign, that \lambda\_{1}/\lambda\_{2} is irrational, and that \eta is real.
Let \theta>0 and \gamma be fixed with \frac{63}{64}<\gamma<1.
Then there exist infinitely many ordered triples of Piatetski-Shapiro primes p\_{1},\,p\_{2},\,p\_{3} of type \gamma such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\lambda\_{1}p\_{1}+\lambda\_{2}p\_{2}+\lambda\_{3}p^{2}\_{3}+\eta|<\big{(}\max\{p\_{% 1},p\_{2},p^{2}\_{3}\}\big{)}^{\frac{63-64\gamma}{52}+\theta}\,. |  |

## 2 Notations

The letter p will always denote a prime number. By \delta we denote an arbitrarily small positive number, not the same in all appearances.
As usual, [t] and \{t\} denote the integer part and the fractional part of t, respectively.
Moreover \psi(t)=\{t\}-\frac{1}{2}. We write e(t)=e^{2\pi it}.
Let \gamma, \theta and \lambda\_{0} be a real constants such that \frac{63}{64}<\gamma<1, \theta>0 and 0<\lambda\_{0}<1.
Since \lambda\_{1}/\lambda\_{2} is irrational, there are infinitely many different convergents
a\_{0}/q\_{0} to its continued fraction, with \big{|}\frac{\lambda\_{1}}{\lambda\_{2}}-\frac{a\_{0}}{q\_{0}}\big{|}<\frac{1}{q\_{%
0}^{2}}\,,(a\_{0},q\_{0})=1\,,a\_{0}\neq 0 and q\_{0} is arbitrary large.
