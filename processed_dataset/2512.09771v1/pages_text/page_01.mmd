###### Abstract

Let [\,\cdot\,] denote the floor function. In this paper, we show that whenever \eta is real and the constants \lambda\_{i} satisfy some necessary conditions,
then for any fixed \frac{63}{64}<\gamma<1 and \theta>0, there exist infinitely many prime triples p\_{1},\,p\_{2},\,p\_{3} satisfying the inequality

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\lambda\_{1}p\_{1}+\lambda\_{2}p\_{2}+\lambda\_{3}p^{2}\_{3}+\eta|<\big{(}\max\{p\_{% 1},p\_{2},p^{2}\_{3}\}\big{)}^{{\frac{63-64\gamma}{52}}+\theta} |  |

and such that p\_{i}=[n\_{i}^{1/\gamma}],  i=1,\,2,\,3.

## 1 Introduction and statement of the result

The study of Diophantine inequalities involving prime numbers constitutes a rapidly evolving field within analytic number theory.
In 1967, A. Baker [1] proved that if \lambda\_{1},\lambda\_{2},\lambda\_{3} are non-zero real numbers, not all of the same sign, \lambda\_{1}/\lambda\_{2} is irrational, \eta is real and A>0,
then there exist infinitely many prime triples p\_{1},\,p\_{2},\,p\_{3} such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\lambda\_{1}p\_{1}+\lambda\_{2}p\_{2}+\lambda\_{3}p\_{3}+\eta|<\varepsilon\_{1}\,, |  | (1) |

where \varepsilon\_{1}=(\log\max p\_{j})^{-A}.
Subsequently, the right-hand side of (1) was improved by Ramachandra [14], Vaughan [19], Lau and Liu [8],
Baker and Harman [2] and Harman [7].
The best result to date is due to Matomäki [10], with \varepsilon\_{1}=(\max p\_{j})^{-\frac{2}{9}+\delta} and \delta>0.
In 2018,Gambini, Languasco and Zaccagnini [6] proved the existence of infinitely many triples of primes p\_{1},\,p\_{2},\,p\_{3} such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\lambda\_{1}p\_{1}+\lambda\_{2}p\_{2}+\lambda\_{3}p^{2}\_{3}+\eta|<\varepsilon\_{2}\,, |  | (2) |

where \varepsilon\_{2}=\big{(}\max\{p\_{1},p\_{2},p^{2}\_{3}\}\big{)}^{-\frac{1}{12}+\delta} and \delta>0.
Weaker results were previously obtained in [9] and [11].
