## 4 Beginning of the proof

Consider the sum

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma(X)=\sum\limits\_{\lambda\_{0}X<p\_{1},p\_{2},p^{2}\_{3}\leq X\atop{p\_{i}=[n^% {1/\gamma}\_{i}],\,i=1,2,3}}\theta(\lambda\_{1}p\_{1}+\lambda\_{2}p\_{2}+\lambda\_{3% }p^{2}\_{3}+\eta)p^{1-\gamma}\_{1}p^{1-\gamma}\_{2}p^{1-\gamma}\_{3}\log p\_{1}\log p% \_{2}\log p\_{3}\,. |  | (12) |

Using the inverse Fourier transform for the function \theta(x), we obtain

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Gamma(X) | \displaystyle=\sum\limits\_{\lambda\_{0}X<p\_{1},p\_{2},p^{2}\_{3}\leq X\atop{p\_{i}% =[n^{1/\gamma}\_{i}],\,i=1,2,3}}p^{1-\gamma}\_{1}p^{1-\gamma}\_{2}p^{1-\gamma}\_{3% }\log p\_{1}\log p\_{2}\log p\_{3} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\times\int\limits\_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Theta(t)e\big{(}(\lambda\_{1}% p\_{1}+\lambda\_{2}p\_{2}+\lambda\_{3}p^{2}\_{3}+\eta)t\big{)}\,dt |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\int\limits\_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Theta(t)S\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t)S\_{1}(% \lambda\_{2}t)S\_{2}(\lambda\_{3}t)e(\eta t)\,dt\,. |  |

We decompose \Gamma(X) as follows

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma(X)=\Gamma\_{1}(X)+\Gamma\_{2}(X)+\Gamma\_{3}(X)\,, |  | (13) |

where

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Gamma\_{1}(X)=\int\limits\_{|t|<\Delta}\Theta(t)S\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t% )S\_{1}(\lambda\_{2}t)S\_{2}(\lambda\_{3}t)e(\eta t)\,dt\,, |  | (14) |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Gamma\_{2}(X)=\int\limits\_{\Delta\leq|t|\leq H}\Theta(t)S\_{1}(% \lambda\_{1}t)S\_{1}(\lambda\_{2}t)S\_{2}(\lambda\_{3}t)e(\eta t)\,dt\,, |  | (15) |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Gamma\_{3}(X)=\int\limits\_{|t|>H}\Theta(t)S\_{1}(\lambda\_{1}t)S\_{1% }(\lambda\_{1}t)S\_{2}(\lambda\_{3}t)e(\eta t)\,dt\,. |  | (16) |

We shall estimate \Gamma\_{1}(X),\,\Gamma\_{2}(X) and \Gamma\_{3}(X), respectively,
in the Sections 5, 6 and 7.
In Section 8 we shall complete the proof of Theorem 1.
