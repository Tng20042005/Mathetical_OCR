###### Abstract

In this paper, for every n\in\mathbb{N}, the following relationships between the functions K\_{b}(n) and K\_{e}(n) and the Bernoulli and Euler numbers are proved:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle B\_{2n} | \displaystyle=-\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}-2}\times K\_{b}(n) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle E\_{2n} | \displaystyle=(2n)!\times K\_{e}(n) |  |

where the functions K\_{b} and K\_{e} are defined recursively as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle K\_{b}(0) | \displaystyle=K\_{e}(0)=1 |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle K\_{b}(n) | \displaystyle=-\sum\_{n^{\prime}=0}^{n-1}\frac{K\_{b}(n^{\prime})}{(2(n-n^{% \prime})+1)!},\quad n\geq 1 |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle K\_{e}(n) | \displaystyle=-\sum\_{n^{\prime}=0}^{n-1}\frac{K\_{e}(n^{\prime})}{(2(n-n^{% \prime}))!},\quad n\geq 1 |  |

Furthermore, we present combinatorial interpretations of these functions in terms of ordered partitions of n, as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle K\_{b}(n) | \displaystyle=\sum\_{\lambda\vDash n}\frac{(-1)^{l(\lambda)}}{\prod\_{i=1}^{l(% \lambda)}(2b\_{i}+1)!},\quad n\geq 1 |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle K\_{e}(n) | \displaystyle=\sum\_{\lambda\vDash n}\frac{(-1)^{l(\lambda)}}{\prod\_{i=1}^{l(% \lambda)}(2b\_{i})!},\quad n\geq 1 |  |

where \lambda=(b\_{1},b\_{2},\ldots,b\_{k})\vDash n and l(\lambda)=k.

## 1 Introduction

The primary objective of this paper is to develop a unified framework for two fundamental families of numbers, the Bernoulli numbers and the Euler numbers, and to introduce new definitions and computational techniques that arise from this shared structure. By relating these numbers to ordered partitions (compositions) of integers, we reveal a novel connection linking number theory, combinatorics, and special functions. In the sections that follow, we provide the necessary definitions and establish the key relations.
