|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M\_{k}\geq m\_{0}+k; |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M\_{k}\geq m\_{0}+z-\mathcal{B}; |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M\_{k}\geq m\_{z}-\mathcal{B}; |  |

That is, M\_{z-\mathcal{B}}, which is a variable, can take the value m\_{z}.

From the summary of the two rules above, it can be concluded that the value m\_{z} is only present in M\_{1} to M\_{z}, and also p(m\_{z}) is present in p(M\_{1}) to p(M\_{z}), and its coefficients are calculable such that for every p(m\_{z}) there is a coefficient T(m\_{z}) that follows the triple rules. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients of p(m\_{z}) in the function h(m\_{0}) will be the sum of T(m\_{z})’s that follow the following triple rules:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{1}=m\_{0},\quad a\_{k}=a\_{k-1}+b\_{k-1},\quad a\_{k}+b\_{k}=M\_{k} |  |

Suppose we want to calculate the coefficient of p(m\_{2}):

As we showed, p(m\_{2}) must be present in the functions p(M\_{1}) to p(M\_{2}), so we disregard p(M\_{3}) because the minimum value it can have is p(m\_{3}). Therefore:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | h(m\_{0})=p(m\_{0})+\sum\_{b\_{1}=1}^{\infty}\sum\_{b\_{2}=1}^{\infty}j(m\_{0},b\_{1})% p(M\_{1})+j(m\_{0},b\_{1})j(M\_{1},b\_{2})p(M\_{2}); |  |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle h(m\_{0})=p(m\_{0}) | \displaystyle+j(m\_{0},1)p(m\_{1})+\sum\_{b\_{2}=1}^{\infty}j(m\_{0},1)j(m\_{1},b\_{2% })p(m\_{1}+b\_{2}) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle+j(m\_{0},2)p(m\_{2})+\sum\_{b\_{2}=1}^{\infty}j(m\_{0},2)j(m\_{2},b\_{2% })p(m\_{2}+b\_{2}); |  |

which for b\_{2}=1 gives us:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle h(m\_{0})=p(m\_{0}) | \displaystyle+j(m\_{0},1)p(m\_{1})+j(m\_{0},1)j(m\_{1},1)p(m\_{2}) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle+j(m\_{0},2)p(m\_{2})+j(m\_{0},2)j(m\_{2},1)p(m\_{3}); |  |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle h(m\_{0})=p(m\_{0}) | \displaystyle+j(m\_{0},1)p(m\_{1})+j(m\_{0},2)j(m\_{2},1)p(m\_{3}) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle+\left(\mathbf{j(m\_{0},1)j(m\_{1},1)+j(m\_{0},2)}\right)p(m\_{2}) |  |

### 3.3 Result

1. The function h(m\_{0}) can be computed as an infinite sum of the function p with the corresponding coefficients.

2. We denote the coefficient of each p(m\_{z}) by T(m\_{z}), which is formed by the product of several functions j(a,b) such that if we have:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T(m\_{z})=j(a\_{1},b\_{1})\times j(a\_{2},b\_{2})\times\ldots\times j(a\_{k-1},b\_{k-% 1})\times j(a\_{k},b\_{k}) |  |

then the following triple rules hold:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{1}=m\_{0},\quad a\_{k}=a\_{k-1}+b\_{k-1},\quad a\_{k}+b\_{k}=m\_{z}=m\_{0}+z |  |
