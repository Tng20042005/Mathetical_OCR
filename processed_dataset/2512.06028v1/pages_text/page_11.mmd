|  | T(m\_{n})=j(a\_{1},b\_{1})\times j(a\_{1}+b\_{1},b\_{2})\times\ldots\times j(a\_{1}+b% \_{1}+\ldots+b\_{k-2},b\_{k-1})\times j(a\_{1}+b\_{1}+\ldots+b\_{k-1},b\_{k}) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{k}=a\_{1}+\sum\_{j=1}^{k-1}b\_{j}; |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{k}+b\_{k}=a\_{1}+\sum\_{j=1}^{k}b\_{j}=m\_{0}+n; |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{j=1}^{k}b\_{j}=n |  |

Therefore, \lambda=(b\_{1},b\_{2},\ldots,b\_{k})\vDash n and l(\lambda)=k.

### 3.6 Lemma 2

If we define the function K\_{b}(n) as follows for every n\in\mathbb{N}:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | K\_{b}(n)=\sum\_{\lambda\vDash n}\frac{(-1)^{l(\lambda)}}{\prod\_{i=1}^{l(\lambda% )}(2b\_{i}+1)!},\quad n\geq 1 |  | (21) |

Then:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | g(n+m\_{0},m\_{0})=\frac{(2n-1)!}{B(2n,2m\_{0})\,2^{2n}}K\_{b}(n) |  | (22) |

### 3.7 Proof

According to previous definitions:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f(n)=\frac{1}{2^{2n}(2n)(2n+1)} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j(a,b)=-\frac{f(b)}{B(2b,2a)}=-\frac{(2a+2b-1)!}{2^{2b}(2b+1)!(2a-1)!}; |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T(m\_{n})=j(a\_{1},b\_{1})\times j(a\_{1}+b\_{1},b\_{2})\times\ldots\times j(a\_{1}+b% \_{1}+\ldots+a\_{k-2},b\_{k-1})\times j(a\_{1}+b\_{1}+\ldots+a\_{k-1},b\_{k}) |  |

Therefore:
