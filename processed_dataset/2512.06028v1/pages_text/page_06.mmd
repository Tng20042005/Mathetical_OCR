## 3 Findings and Proofs

### 3.1 Theorem 1

If we define the functions K\_{b}(n) and K\_{e}(n) as follows for every n\in\mathbb{N}:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle K\_{b}(n) | \displaystyle=\sum\_{\lambda\vDash n}\frac{(-1)^{l(\lambda)}}{\prod\_{i=1}^{l(% \lambda)}(2b\_{i}+1)!},\quad n\geq 1 |  | (9) |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle K\_{e}(n) | \displaystyle=\sum\_{\lambda\vDash n}\frac{(-1)^{l(\lambda)}}{\prod\_{i=1}^{l(% \lambda)}(2b\_{i})!},\quad n\geq 1 |  | (10) |

where \lambda=(b\_{1},b\_{2},\ldots,b\_{k}) represents the ordered partitions of n and l(\lambda)=k is the length of each partition, then the following relations hold for Bernoulli and Euler numbers:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle B\_{2n} | \displaystyle=-\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}-2}\times K\_{b}(n) |  | (11) |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle E\_{2n} | \displaystyle=(2n)!\times K\_{e}(n) |  | (12) |

In addition , the functions K\_{b}(n) and K\_{e}(n) can be computed recursively by the following relations:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | K\_{b}(n)=\begin{cases}1&n=0\\ -\sum\_{n^{\prime}=0}^{n-1}\frac{K\_{b}(n^{\prime})}{(2(n-n^{\prime})+1)!}&n\geq 1% \end{cases} |  | (13) |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | K\_{e}(n)=\begin{cases}1&n=0\\ -\sum\_{n^{\prime}=0}^{n-1}\frac{K\_{e}(n^{\prime})}{(2(n-n^{\prime}))!}&n\geq 1% \end{cases} |  | (14) |

### 3.2 Proof

An equation for the polygamma function exists in article number [11], page 430, as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \psi^{y}(x+1)=(-1)^{y-1}(y)!\,\zeta(y+1,x+1)\quad\text{where }y\in\mathbb{N},% \ x+1\notin\mathbb{Z}\_{0}^{-} |  | (15) |

Therefore, substituting (8) into (15), we have the following.
