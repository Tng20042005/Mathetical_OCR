|  | \zeta(y+1,x+1)=\frac{1}{y\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{y}}-\sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}% \frac{f(n)(2n+y)!\,\zeta(2n+y+1,x+1)}{(2n-1)!y!} |  |

By the definition of the Beta function [8]:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | B(2n,2m\_{0})=\frac{(2n-1)!(2m\_{0}-1)!}{(2n+2m\_{0}-1)!} |  |

Now let:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | y=2m\_{0}-1 |  |

Then we have the following.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \zeta(2m\_{0},x+1)=\frac{1}{(2m\_{0}-1)\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2m\_{0}-1}}-% \sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{f(n)\,\zeta(2(n+m\_{0}),x+1)}{B(2n,2m\_{0})} |  | (16) |

Then let:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | h(m\_{0})=\zeta(2m\_{0},x+1) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | p(m\_{0})=\frac{1}{(2m\_{0}-1)\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2m\_{0}-1}} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M\_{k}=m\_{0}+\sum\_{j=1}^{k}b\_{j} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m\_{k}=m\_{0}+k |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j(a\_{k},b\_{k})=-\frac{f(b\_{k})}{B(2b\_{k},2a\_{k})} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T(M\_{k})=j(m\_{0},b\_{1})j(M\_{1},b\_{2})\times\ldots\times j(M\_{k-2},b\_{k-1})% \times j(M\_{k-1},b\_{k}) |  |

Then:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{1}=m\_{0} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{k}=M\_{k-1}=m\_{0}+\sum\_{j=1}^{k-1}b\_{j}=m\_{0}+\sum\_{j=1}^{k-2}b\_{j}+\ B\_{k-1}; |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{k}=a\_{k-1}+b\_{k-1} |  |

Therefore, in the function T(M\_{k}), the following two rules hold:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{1}=m\_{0},\quad a\_{k}=a\_{k-1}+b\_{k-1} |  |

Now we rewrite equation (16) as follows:
