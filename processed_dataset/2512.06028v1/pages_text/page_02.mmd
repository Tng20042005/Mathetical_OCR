### 2.1 Ordered Partitions of n

An ordered partition (composition) of n is a sequence of positive integers \lambda=(b\_{1},b\_{2},\ldots,b\_{k}) such that:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | b\_{1}+b\_{2}+\ldots+b\_{k}=n |  |

where the order of the components matters and the number of components (k) is called the length of the partition.

### 2.2 Bernoulli Numbers

Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705), a Swiss mathematician and physicist, first systematically studied Bernoulli numbers in 1713. These numbers emerged during his investigations of the sums of powers of natural numbers and became a fundamental tool in number theory and analysis [1]. Over time, the connection of this sequence of numbers with the expansions of many functions, including the zeta function, has been established; thus, Bernoulli numbers hold great importance in mathematics. In general, the sum \sum\_{k=1}^{n-1}k^{r} can be written as follows [2]:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{k=1}^{n-1}k^{r}=\sum\_{k=0}^{r}\frac{B\_{k}\,r!\,n^{r-k+1}}{k!(r-k+1)!} |  |

where B\_{k} is independent of r and are called Bernoulli numbers.

### 2.3 Euler Numbers

Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) studied Euler numbers in 1755 in his book Institutiones Calculi Differentialis [3]. These numbers, which initially appeared in the context of expansions of trigonometric series, gradually found extensive applications in combinatorics and graph theory. By discovering the connection between these numbers and specific permutations, Euler laid foundations that are still used in combinatorial research today. These numbers form a sequence E\_{n} of natural numbers defined by the Taylor series as follows [4]:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \frac{1}{\cosh(t)}=\frac{2}{e^{t}+e^{-t}}=\sum\_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{E\_{n}}{n!}t% ^{n} |  |

### 2.4 Zeta Function

The Riemann zeta function \zeta(s) was first studied by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century for real numbers (s>1), but Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) extended it to complex numbers in 1859 [7].This function is defined for \text{Re(s)}>1 as:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \zeta(s)=\sum\_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{s}} |  |

Riemann showed that this function can be analytically continued for all complex numbers except s=1 (where it has a simple pole). This function has a deep connection with the distribution of prime numbers [7].

### 2.5 Hurwitz Zeta Function

The Hurwitz zeta function, a generalization of the Riemann zeta function, was introduced by Adolf Hurwitz (1859-1919) in 1882. For \text{Re(s)}>1, it is defined as an absolutely convergent series [8]:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \zeta(s,x)=\sum\_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{s}};\quad\frac{d}{dx}\zeta(s,x)=% -s\,\zeta(s+1,x) |  |

This function can be extended to other values of s by analytic continuation, except at s=1 where the function has a simple pole.

Generalized harmonic functions H\_{x}^{s} can be expressed via the Hurwitz zeta function:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | H\_{x}^{s}=\sum\_{n=1}^{x}\frac{1}{n^{s}}=\sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}-% \sum\_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x+1)^{s}}; |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | H\_{x}^{s}=\zeta(s)-\zeta(s,x+1); |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \frac{d}{dx}(H\_{x}^{s})=s\,\zeta(s+1,x+1) |  |
