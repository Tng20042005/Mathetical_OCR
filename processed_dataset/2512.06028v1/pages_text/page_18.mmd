### 3.15 Connection with Euler Numbers

First, we define the function K\_{e}(n) as the following determinant:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | K\_{e}(n)=\begin{vmatrix}1&0&0&\cdots&1\\ \frac{1}{2!}&1&0&\cdots&0\\ \frac{1}{4!}&\frac{1}{2!}&1&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \frac{1}{(2n)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-2)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-4)!}&\cdots&\frac{1}{2!}&0\end{vmatrix} |  | (34) |

In article [4], the following relations for computing Bernoulli and Euler numbers based on determinants are provided:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | B\_{2n}=-\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}-2}\times\begin{vmatrix}1&0&0&\cdots&1\\ \frac{1}{3!}&1&0&\cdots&0\\ \frac{1}{5!}&\frac{1}{3!}&1&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \frac{1}{(2n+1)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-1)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-3)!}&\cdots&\frac{1}{3!}&0% \end{vmatrix} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E\_{2n}=(2n)!\times\begin{vmatrix}1&0&0&\cdots&1\\ \frac{1}{2!}&1&0&\cdots&0\\ \frac{1}{4!}&\frac{1}{2!}&1&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \frac{1}{(2n)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-2)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-4)!}&\cdots&\frac{1}{2!}&0\end{vmatrix} |  |

Therefore, according to the definition of K\_{e}(n) in equation (34), the Euler relation can be rewritten as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | E\_{2n}=(2n)!\times K\_{e}(n) |  | (35) |

Also, substituting equation (33) into the formula for Bernoulli numbers, the determinant representation of K\_{b}(n) is obtained as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | K\_{b}(n)=\begin{vmatrix}1&0&0&\cdots&1\\ \frac{1}{3!}&1&0&\cdots&0\\ \frac{1}{5!}&\frac{1}{3!}&1&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \frac{1}{(2n+1)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-1)!}&\frac{1}{(2n-3)!}&\cdots&\frac{1}{3!}&0% \end{vmatrix} |  |

Comparing the two determinants K\_{b}(n) and K\_{e}(n) shows that they share the same structure, the only difference being that the odd factorials (from 3! to (2n+1)!) in K\_{b}(n) are replaced by even factorials (from 2! to (2n)!) in K\_{e}(n).

Consequently, if the function F is defined as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F((2i+1)!)=K\_{b}(n)\quad\quad n\geq i |  |

Then:
