### 2.7 Digamma Function

The Digamma Function is obtained by differentiating the logarithm of the Gamma function as follows:

|  | \frac{d}{dx}\Gamma(x)=\Gamma(x)\psi(x); |  |

|  | \Gamma(x+1)\psi(x+1)=\frac{\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{2}}% {e^{x+A(x,-\frac{1}{2})}}\left(\ln\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\frac{dA}{dx}% \right); |  |

|  | \psi(x+1)=\ln\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\frac{dA}{dx}; |  |
