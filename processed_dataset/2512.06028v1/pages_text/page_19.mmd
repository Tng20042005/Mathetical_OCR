|  | F\left((2i)!\right)=K\_{e}(n)\quad\quad n\geq i |  |

Therefore, considering relations (9) and (13) previously obtained for K\_{b}(n), and by applying the modifications related to replacing odd factorials with even factorials, the equivalent relations for K\_{e}(n) can be deduced as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | K\_{e}(n)=-\sum\_{n^{\prime}=0}^{n-1}\frac{K\_{e}(n^{\prime})}{(2(n-n^{\prime}))!% }\quad\quad n\geq 1 |  | (36) |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | K\_{e}(n)=\sum\_{\lambda\vDash n}\frac{(-1)^{l(\lambda)}}{\prod\_{i=1}^{l(\lambda% )}(2b\_{i})!}\quad\quad n\geq 1 |  | (37) |

These relations provide independent computational methods for K\_{e}(n) that can be used for the efficient computation of Euler numbers.

## 4 Conclusion

In this paper, we have established a unified framework that connects Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers to ordered partitions of integers through the functions K\_{b}(n) and K\_{e}(n). By deriving recursive relations and combinatorial interpretations for these functions, we have developed novel methods for computing these important sequences, which originate from expansions of special functions such as the zeta, Gamma, and polygamma functions.

This connection not only reveals a deeper interplay between number theory and combinatorics, but also offers practical advantages for numerical evaluations. Representing these numbers through ordered partitions provides a better understanding of their structure and enables more efficient computations. This approach may pave the way for future research in generalizing these relationships to other numerical sequences and their applications in analytic and combinatorial number theory.
