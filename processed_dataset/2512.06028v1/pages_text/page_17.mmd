### 3.14 Connection with Bernoulli Numbers

We previously showed:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \psi(x+1)=\ln\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a\_{n}}{\left(% x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2n}}; |  |

In article [10], a similar equation for the digamma function is discussed as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \psi(x+1)=\ln\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)+\sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{B\_{2n}\left(1% -\frac{1}{2^{2n-1}}\right)}{2n\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2n}}; |  |

Therefore, by comparing the two equations above, the relation between the Bernoulli numbers and the coefficients a\_{n} is obtained as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{n}=\frac{B\_{2n}}{2n}\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{2n-1}}\right); |  | (33) |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | B\_{2n}=\frac{2n\times a\_{n}}{\left(1-\frac{1}{2^{2n-1}}\right)} |  |

Also, we previously showed:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{n}=\frac{-(2n-1)!}{2^{2n}}K\_{b}(n) |  |

As a result:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbf{B\_{2n}}=-\frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n}-2}\times\mathbf{K\_{b}(n)} |  | (33) |

Therefore, using the coefficients \mathbf{K\_{b}(n)}, we will be able to easily compute Bernoulli numbers.
