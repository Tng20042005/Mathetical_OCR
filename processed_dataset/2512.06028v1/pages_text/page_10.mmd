3. If we decompose the function h according to equation (17) and also decompose the resulting h functions from the decomposition with the same equation, and factor out the resulting p functions like p(m\_{z}), and sum their coefficients, i.e., the T(m\_{z})’s, we will have:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | h(m\_{0})=p(m\_{0})+\sum\_{z=1}^{\infty}\left(\sum T(m\_{z})\right)p(m\_{z}); |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | h(m\_{0})=p(m\_{0})+\sum\_{z=1}^{\infty}\left(\sum T(m\_{0}+z)\right)p(m\_{0}+z); |  |

Let:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g(z+m\_{0},m\_{0})=\sum T(m\_{0}+z); |  |

Then:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | h(m\_{0})=p(m\_{0})+\sum\_{z=1}^{\infty}g(z+m\_{0},m\_{0})p(m\_{0}+z); |  | (19) |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \zeta(2m\_{0},x+1)=\frac{1}{(2m\_{0}-1)\left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2m\_{0}-1}}+% \sum\_{z=1}^{\infty}\frac{g(z+m\_{0},m\_{0})}{(2m\_{0}+2z-1)\left(x+\frac{1}{2}% \right)^{2m\_{0}+2z-1}} |  | (20) |

Therefore, we showed that the coefficient of p(m\_{0}+z) in the function h(m\_{0}) is the function g(z+m\_{0},m\_{0}), which is formed by the sum of all T(m\_{z})’s that follow the triple rules. In the following, we obtain an easier way to compute these coefficients.

### 3.4 Lemma 1

For every T(m\_{n}) from the function g(n+m\_{0},m\_{0}), the following relation holds:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{j=1}^{k}b\_{j}=n |  |

More precisely, the sum of the b’s of the functions j(a,b) in a T(m\_{n}) that satisfies equation (14), i.e., follows the triple rules, is equal to n. That is, if we set \lambda=(b\_{1},b\_{2},\ldots,b\_{k}), then \lambda\vDash n and l(\lambda)=k.

### 3.5 Proof

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T(m\_{n})=j(a\_{1},b\_{1})\times j(a\_{2},b\_{2})\times\ldots\times j(a\_{k-1},b\_{k-% 1})\times j(a\_{k},b\_{k}) |  |

According to the triple rules:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a\_{1}=m\_{0},\quad a\_{k-1}+b\_{k-1}=a\_{k},\quad a\_{k}+b\_{k}=m\_{n}=m\_{0}+n |  |

Therefore:

|  |  |  |
