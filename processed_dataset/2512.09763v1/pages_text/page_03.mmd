The study of evolution equations on \mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) lead to the need of working with the tangent space to \mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) at some point \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). An early and influential work in this direction is [20] which was in fact concerned with L^{1} spaces. Following [2] Section 8.4, several works including namely [16, 11] have then argue that the tangent space to (\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}),W\_{p}) at \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) is

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1) |  | \overline{\nabla\_{x}C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{d},\mathbb{R})}^{L^{p^{\prime}}((% \mathbb{R}^{d},\mu),\mathbb{R}^{d})}. |  |

Here, we present a different point of view and consider instead the tangent space to \mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) at \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) to be given by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2) |  | T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})):=\left\{\psi:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to% \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d}),\text{ measurable }\bigg{|}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{2d}}|% z|^{p^{\prime}}\psi\_{x}(dz)\mu(dx)<\infty\right\}. |  |

By disintegration, it is equivalent to considering the set of probability measures \gamma\in\mathcal{P}\_{pp^{\prime}}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}) such that (\pi\_{1})\_{\#}\gamma=\mu and we shall sometimes say with a slight abuse of notation that some \gamma(dx,dz)=\mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz) belongs to T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) if \psi does. Pursuing in this direction, we define T\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}):=\cup\_{\mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})}%
\{\mu\}\times T\_{\mu}\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) which will be identified with \mathcal{P}\_{pp^{\prime}}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}).

Of course, for all elements \phi in the tangent space defined in (1), we have an associated elements in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) by considering the map \psi:x\to\delta\_{\phi(x)}, such elements shall be called deterministic.

We provide in the next sections applications which we believe justify precisely this notion of tangent space. We finish this section by giving some heuristics to support our definition of tangent space.

### 2.2. Heuristics

#### 2.2.1. What can be found in the literature

A similar notion of tangent space was in fact considered in [17] and Section 12.4 in [2] (the so-called velocity plans), with the restriction to maps \psi satisfying some sort of optimality, arising from the fact that only couplings arising from geodesics of optimal transport were considered. In regard to their definition, our main contribution is simply to avoid this restriction of T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})). Furthermore, we point out the work [17, 3] which, despite not identifying the same tangent space as us, studies it and provides interesting results concerning the decomposition of T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) into (1) and what could be interpreted as its orthogonal space.

Somehow, the comparison result we established in [5] is a natural application of the choice of tangent space. Indeed, by considering extended super-differentials (see Section 10.3 in [2]), we showed that comparison principles are immediate for Hamilton-Jacobi equation in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{T}^{d}). Hence, we allowed to seek for elements in super-differentials which are in T\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), and not only in some set defined as in (1). This sort of ideas were later also used in [10, 8].

More generally, the notion of extended super-differentials of [2] basically seeks to define what does it mean for an element of T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) to be in the super-differential of a function U:\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to\mathbb{R} at the point \mu.
