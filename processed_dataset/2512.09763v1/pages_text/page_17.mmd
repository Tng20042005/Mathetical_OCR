Hence, it only remains to verify the completeness. Let (U\_{n})\_{n\geq 0} be a Cauchy sequence for \mathcal{N}. Since it is one for the \|\cdot\|\_{\infty} norm, we know that it converges uniformly toward some function U, which is continuous. To prove the convergence of the derivative, consider the map \phi\_{n}:\mu\mapsto\mu(dx)\delta\_{D\_{\mu}U\_{n}(\mu)(x)}(dz), valued in \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}). Remark that for any \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), (\phi\_{n}(\mu))\_{n\geq 0} is a Cauchy sequence. Indeed, since we can write d\_{\mu}(D\_{\mu}U\_{n}(\mu)-D\_{\mu}U\_{m}(\mu),0)=W\_{2}(\phi\_{n},\phi\_{m}). Hence, (\phi\_{n}(\mu))\_{n\geq 0} converges to some g(\mu)\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}) with first marginal \mu. Furthermore, this convergence is uniform in \mu. We now need to check that g=D\_{\mu}U. Since, for all n\geq 0, U\_{n} is \mathcal{C}^{1}, we obtain that for any \gamma\in\Pi(\mu,\nu) for \mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | U\_{n}(\nu)-U\_{n}(\mu)=\int\_{0}^{1}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{2d}}D\_{\mu}U\_{n}(((1-t)\pi% \_{1}+t\pi\_{2})\_{\#}\gamma)(x)(y-x)\gamma(dx,dy)dt. |  |

Passing to the limit in this expression, and denoting \gamma(dx,dy)=\mu(dx)k\_{x}(dy), we deduce that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | U(\nu)-U(\mu)=\int\_{0}^{1}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{3d}}z\cdot(y-x)g(((1-t)\pi\_{1}+t% \pi\_{2})\_{\#}\gamma)(dx,dz)k\_{x}(dy)dt. |  |

From this, we deduce that, if we denote g(\mu)(dx,dz)=\mu(dx)\psi\_{\mu,x}(dz), then x\mapsto\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}z\psi\_{\mu,x}(dz)=D\_{\mu}U(\mu). In fact, we can show that g(\mu) is in fact of the form (Id,\phi)\_{\#}\mu for some map \phi, which is then nothing else than D\_{\mu}U(\mu). In this setting, this is a consequence of Theorem 3.17 in [16] (it is even a consequence of a weaker results of Lions in [19] under our assumptions). Hence, we obtained that U is differentiable everywhere. Passing to the limit in the quotient which defined I\_{\alpha}(U\_{n}), we easily obtained that I\_{\alpha}(U)<\infty, hence, the result is proved.

∎

We also recall Proposition 5.36, vol I in [11], stated with other notation, but which here takes the form.

###### Proposition 6.12.

Let U:\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to\mathbb{R} be such that I\_{1}(D\_{\mu}U)<\infty. Then, for any \mu, there exists a I\_{1}(D\_{\mu}U) Lipschitz function \phi\_{\mu}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}^{d} such that D\_{\mu}U=\phi\_{\mu} \mu almost everywhere.

We do not reproduce its rather heavy proof and we leave the reader to check that its proof does not use the Hilbert structure of L^{2}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{d}), and that it can be thus extended instantly to the case of a function U:\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{O})\to\mathbb{R} for \mathcal{O} a smooth domain.

### 6.6. Discussion on the \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha} norm and its consequences

There are mainly two points that we want to insist upon in the definition of I\_{\alpha} in (7).

The first one is the fact that the supremum is taken over all couplings and not only over optimal couplings. As we mentioned above, the same choice/problem arises when defining the notion of derivative, and it has be shown in [16] that the two notions are equivalent. Of course, for I\_{\alpha}, one implies the other, but it is not clear for us to show an equivalence between the two notions and we leave this question for future research. In particular, the proof of [16] uses in a crucial manner the fact that the term we want to estimate can be seen as a part of a Taylor expansion, which is not true here.
