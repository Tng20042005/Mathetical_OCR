where the first infimum is taken over parallel transports \Psi of \phi along geodesics joining \mu toward \nu, the second one over parallel transports \Psi^{\prime} of \psi along geodesics joining \nu toward \mu and where we use the notations (e\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi(dx,dz)=\nu(dx)\phi^{\prime}\_{x}(dz) and (e\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi^{\prime}(dx,dz)=\mu(dx)\psi^{\prime}\_{x}(dz).

###### Proof.

Define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | I\_{1}:=\inf\_{\Psi}d^{2}\_{\nu}(\phi^{\prime},\psi),\quad I\_{2}:=\inf\_{\Psi^{% \prime}}d^{2}\_{\mu}(\phi,\psi^{\prime}). |  |

We need to prove I\_{1}=I\_{2}. Let \Psi be a parallel transport of \phi along a geodesic \theta joining \mu toward \nu. Furthermore, consider an optimal coupling between (e\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi and \nu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz). By gluing the two together, we are allowed to consider random variables (X,Z,Y,Z^{\prime}) such that (X,Y) is an optimal coupling for W\_{2}(\mu,\nu), \mathcal{L}(X,Z)=\mu(dx)\phi\_{x}(dz),\mathcal{L}(Y,Z^{\prime})=\nu(dx)\psi\_{x}%
(dz) and (Y,Z,Z^{\prime}) is optimal for d^{2}\_{\nu}(\phi^{\prime},\psi). The cost in I\_{1} associated to \Psi is thus \mathbb{E}[|Z-Z^{\prime}|^{2}]. Note that \mathcal{L}(((1-t)Y+tX,Z^{\prime})\_{t\in[0,1]}) provides a parallel transport of (\nu,\psi) along a geodesic joining \nu toward \mu. Hence, if we call \Psi^{\prime} this parallel transport, its associated cost in I\_{2} is d^{2}\_{\mu}(\phi,\psi^{\prime})\leq\mathbb{E}[|Z-Z^{\prime}|^{2}]. Hence, we deduce that I\_{2}\leq I\_{1}. By symmetry, we conclude that I\_{1}=I\_{2}.
∎

###### Remark 6.2.

We could also have defined \mathcal{E} with a supremum over geodesics, and we would have arrived at a somehow similar notion.

### 6.3. A distance on T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})

There is no reason that a distance on T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) can be derived immediately from \mathcal{E}. This type of phenomena also occurs in differential geometry. We propose here a distance on T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) and present links with the quantity \mathcal{E}. Let \mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) and \phi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})),\psi\in T\_{\nu}(\mathcal{P}\_{%
2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})). Recall that by disintegration, considering (\mu,\phi) is equivalent to considering \gamma(dx,dz)=\mu(dx)\phi\_{x}(dz)\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}). Thus, we identify the tangent sheaf with \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}). Hence, measuring the distance between (\mu,\phi) and (\nu,\psi) can be done by means of the Wasserstein distance on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}), which yields the definition of our distance:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{D}^{2}((\mu,\phi),(\nu,\psi)):=W\_{2}^{2}(\mu(dx)\phi\_{x}(dz),\nu(dx)% \psi\_{x}(dz)). |  |

The standard properties of the Wasserstein distance imply the following.

###### Proposition 6.3.

The function \mathcal{D} defines a metric on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}). Furthermore, for any \mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) and \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})),\phi\in T\_{\nu}(\mathcal{P}\_{%
2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})), \mathcal{D}((\mu,\phi),(\nu,\psi))\geq W^{2}\_{2}(\mu,\nu).

A bound from above on \mathcal{D}^{2} can be obtained as follows.

###### Proposition 6.4.

Let \mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), and \phi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})),\psi\in T\_{\nu}(\mathcal{P}\_{%
2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})). Then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (6) |  | \mathcal{D}^{2}((\mu,\phi),(\nu,\psi))\leq W\_{2}^{2}(\mu,\nu)+\mathcal{E}((\mu% ,\phi),(\nu,\psi)). |  |

Furthermore, the inequality can be strict and we do not have in general \mathcal{E}\leq\mathcal{D}^{2}.

###### Proof.

Consider a parallel transport of \phi along a geodesic between \mu and \nu. This naturally defines a coupling between \mu(dx)\phi\_{x}(dz) and \nu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz). Hence, the left hand side is smaller than the right hand side in (6).

When (\mu,\phi)=\mathcal{L}((U,\lambda U)) and (\mu,\psi)=\mathcal{L}((1-U,\lambda U)) for U a uniform random variable on [0,1] (hence \nu=\mu), we can compute \mathcal{E}((\mu,\phi),(\mu,\psi))=\lambda^{2}/3 whereas \mathcal{D}^{2}((\mu,\phi),(\mu,\psi))\leq 1/3.
