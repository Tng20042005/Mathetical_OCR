The previous result highlights the fact that there is a choice to be made when comparing different element in T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). A point of view purely based on parallel transport should rely on the quantity \mathcal{E}. On the other hand, taking inspiration from differential geometry, \mathcal{D} seems to behave like the natural geodesic distance on T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). Outside of this section, we shall focus on the approach with parallel transport, namely because it is more natural when being interested in the regularity of functions U:\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to\mathbb{R}.

We do not go into the full details of constructing an equivalent of the Sasaki metric on the tangent sheaf T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) (it is a natural metric when we try to look at T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) as a Riemannian manifold), as we do not need it for applications. Nonetheless, we briefly comment on it since \mathcal{D} looks like what the Sasaki distance could be. Building on the structure of T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) which can be seen as \mathcal{P}(T\mathbb{R}^{d}) with T\mathbb{R}^{d}=\mathbb{R}^{2d}, we know that T(T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) can be seen as \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{4d}). Furthermore, the normal crossing of the vertical part of the tangent space to T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) of the parallel transport can be stated formally quite simply, namely as the tangent part of the parallel transport is constant in this case in flat geometry. The precise decomposition of T\_{\gamma}T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) into an horizontal and a vertical part seems to be the most interesting question here. Clearly, by the construction we proposed for parallel transport, it is immediate to check that (\frac{d}{dt})\_{\#}\Psi is concentrated on curves (x(t),v(t)) on T\mathbb{R}^{d} such that v^{\prime}(t) crosses normally the tangent space T\_{x(t)}\mathbb{R}^{d}.

### 6.4. Reminders: Derivatives of function of probability measures

Let U:\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to\mathbb{R}. The function U is said to be differentiable at \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) if there exist a *deterministic* element \phi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) and a modulus of continuity \omega such that, for any \nu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \gamma\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left|U(\nu)-U(\mu)-\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{2d}}(y-x)\cdot\phi(x)\gamma(dx,dy)\right% |\leq C\_{2}(\gamma)\omega(C\_{2}(\gamma)), |  |

recall that C\_{2}(\gamma):=\left(\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{2d}}|x-y|^{2}\gamma(dx,dy)\right)^{%
\frac{1}{2}}. In such a case we note D\_{\mu}U(\mu)=\phi\in L^{2}((\mathbb{R}^{d},\mu),\mathbb{R}^{d}).

###### Remark 6.5.

There are different notions of differentiability on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) that can be found in the literature, see chapter 5 in [11] for instance. Quite often, in the previous definition, the requirement is only made for coupling \gamma which are optimal for W\_{2}(\mu,\nu). In fact, there is an equivalence between the two notions, see Theorem 3.21 in [16], and we do not know any short proof of this fact. Here, we prefer to stick to the formulation with all couplings, as it is a nice non-Hilbertian formulation of the derivative introduced by P.-L. Lions on the lift of the function. In particular, one can check that we do not use in the following the Hilbertian structure of L^{2}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{d}).

###### Remark 6.6.

The previous definition of differentiability contains the fact that D\_{\mu}U(\mu) is a deterministic element of the tangent space. This fact is not obvious. It has been proven by Lions in [19] by introducing its lift on the space of random variables.

### 6.5. \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha} regularity on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})

Let U:\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to\mathbb{R} be a differentiable map at any \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). The aim of this section is to define a notion of continuity, Hölder or Lipschitz regularity for the map \mu\to D\_{\mu}U(\mu). Of course, since for every \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), D\_{\mu}U(\mu)\in L^{2}((\mathbb{R}^{d},\mu),\mathbb{R}^{d}), this
