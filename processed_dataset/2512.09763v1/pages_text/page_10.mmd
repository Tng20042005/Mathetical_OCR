In [1, 18], the authors are mostly interested with what we can call Eulerian paths on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), that is those that can be represented as solution to a continuity equation of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial\_{t}m+\text{div}\_{x}(\alpha\_{t}m)=0\text{ in }(0,1)\times\mathbb{R}^{d}, |  |

where (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]}\in\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) is the path in question and \alpha:[0,1]\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}^{d}, the velocity that moves the underlying particles. We refer to Section 7.1 below for more insights and references on such dynamics.

The authors then show that under certain regularity assumptions on \alpha, the ODE \dot{x}=\alpha(t,x) defines a sufficiently smooth flow, along which they can then parallel transport the deterministic elements of the tangent space, while projecting it onto the space of gradients, namely to ensure that the new vector field will have a 0 rotational.

Our point of view is that the two approaches coincide (up to the projection that we do want to use here) when the one of [1, 18] is well defined, but that we are able to avoid quite a lot of technical details because we do not use the Eulerian formulation of the path at interest. Of course, the downside of our approach is that we lose uniqueness of parallel transport in certain pathological cases. Furthermore, we believe our different examples justify this loss of uniqueness as natural.

## 4. Links with Lions’ lift

The definitions and results of the previous section might seem rather obscure in terms of their notation. This section somehow enlightens them by making transparent the translation in terms of random variables, following the powerful lifting approach developed by P.-L. Lions in [19], that we now recall. Let (\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P}) be a standard atomeless probabilistic space and H=L^{2}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{d}) the separable Hilbert space of square integrable \mathbb{R}^{d} valued random variables on \Omega. The point of view developed by P.-L. Lions, mainly to study partial differential equations over \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), is simply to lift problems on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) into problems on H, an approach that we follow in this section.

Since H is flat, parallel transport in H is rather obvious. The tangent plan at X\in H in always H itself and the parallel transport of a vector Z\in H above some initial point X\in H along a curve \theta:[0,1]\to H,t\to\theta(t):=X\_{t} is the constant function Z.

The main link between the two approaches is the following proposition, which is a tautology.

###### Proposition 4.1.

* •

  Consider a \mathbb{R}^{d} valued process (X\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]}, which is almost surely continuous in t, such that \sup\_{t\in[0,1]}\|X\_{t}\|\_{H}<\infty and Z\in H. Note \mathcal{L}(X\_{0},Z):=\mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz). Then, \mathcal{L}((X\_{t},Z)\_{t\in[0,1]}) is a parallel transport of \psi along \mathcal{L}((X\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]}).
* •

  Conversely, consider \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) and \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu and a parallel transport \Psi of \psi along \eta. Then, any (X\_{t},Z)\_{t\in[0,1]} of law \Psi is the parallel transport in H of Z along (X\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]}.

The above transposition is so simple that it can be tempting to restrict ourselves to working on H and then pull back all the information we have at the level of \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). This might be misleading if we work with probability measures on other domains than \mathbb{R}^{d}, as the underlying Hilbertian structure collapses. The next section extends this notion of parallel transport to cases of probability measures on smooth domain of \mathbb{R}^{d} or on manifolds, showing that in Lions’ approach, the lift is more important than the Hilbertian structure.

## 5. Tangent space and parallel transport on \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{O})

We expand rapidly the notion of parallel transport on \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{O}) when \mathcal{O} is either a smooth bounded domain of \mathbb{R}^{d} or a smooth compact Riemannian manifold M.
