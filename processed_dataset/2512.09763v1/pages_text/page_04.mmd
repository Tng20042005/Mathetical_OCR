Furthermore, recent developments [12, 13, 14] in the precise characterization of not so smooth dynamics on \mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) have made a systematic use of so-called multi valued probability vector fields, which are somehow vector fields on the tangent space we defined above.

#### 2.2.2. Young measures

The main issue when dealing with (1) is that the latter space behaves quite badly with \mu. The next example is a good illustration of this phenomenon.

###### Example 2.1.

Let d=1, \mu=\delta\_{0} and consider for \epsilon>0, \mu\_{\epsilon}:=\mathcal{N}(0,\epsilon), the Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance \epsilon. Clearly W\_{2}(\mu,\mu\_{\epsilon})\to 0 as \epsilon\to 0. For any \epsilon>0, the function f(x)=\text{sign}(x)\text{ if }x\neq 0, is in L^{2}((\mathbb{R},\mu\_{\epsilon}),\mathbb{R}). However, the statement f\in L^{2}((\mathbb{R},\mu),\mathbb{R}) is far from being clear. More generally L^{2}((\mathbb{R},\mu),\mathbb{R}) has not much to do with L^{2}((\mathbb{R},\mu\_{\epsilon}),\mathbb{R}), even when \epsilon is small but non-zero.

Hence, it seems that when dealing with (1), we loose a lot of information at some point compared to what can happen in a close neighborhood. In our opinion, it is reminiscent of an old problem faced in calculus of variations which has been solved by Young [21]. He introduced what are now called Young measures, which allow to capture some oscillatory, random or complex behavior of sequences of functions by considering objects similar to the ones of (2). Usually in Young measures, the reference measure \mu is fixed and we are simply taking limits of functions. Here, we claim that if we allow \mu to vary also, then we naturally end up with T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) if we want to keep all this information.

Typical problems in Young measures are to characterize the limit of functions f\_{n}:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R} defines as the almost everywhere derivative of g\_{n}, a piecewise affine function which takes value 0 on \frac{k}{2^{n}} if k is even, and value 1 if k is odd, and which is smooth outside of these points. Typically, Young measures allow to state that, in some sense, f\_{n} converges toward the measured valued map \psi:[0,1]\to\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}) which is constant and takes value \frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{-1}+\delta\_{1}).

In Example 2.1, in some sense, it is natural to say that the limit version of f\in L^{2}((\mathbb{R},\mu\_{\epsilon}),\mathbb{R}) is to say that the function defined only on \{0\} by \big{(}0\to\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{-1}+\delta\_{1})\big{)} is an element of T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})).

The point of view of Young measures can be interpreted as the fact that a relaxation of a functional space usually leads to considering measured value functions. This is quite in the spirit of the powerful Kantorovich relaxation of optimal transport, in fact it is an omnipresent idea in optimization, analysis or calculus of variations that we feel deserved to be highlighted here.
