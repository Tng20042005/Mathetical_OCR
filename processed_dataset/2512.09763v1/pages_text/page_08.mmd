Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}),\psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{%
R}^{d})). Let \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) being defined as the law of ((1-t)X^{\prime}+tY^{\prime}) for (X^{\prime},Y^{\prime}) a couple of random variables of joint law \gamma\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}). Then the construction of the parallel transport is somehow more understandable. Consider (X,Y,Z) random variables such that \mathcal{L}(X,Y)=\gamma and \mathcal{L}(X,Z)=\mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz). Then a parallel transport of \psi along \eta is given by the law of t\mapsto((1-t)X+tY,Z). Note that here also, the existence of (X,Y,Z) is guaranteed by the gluing Lemma.

The next result relies heavily on the fact that the parallel transport in \mathbb{R}^{d} is trivial, in the sense that it only depends on the starting and end points.

###### Proposition 3.6.

Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})), \eta\_{1},\eta\_{2}\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta\_{i}=\mu for i=1,2 and \Psi a parallel transport of \psi along \eta\_{1}. If (e\_{0},e\_{1})\_{\#}\eta\_{1}=(e\_{0},e\_{1})\_{\#}\eta\_{2}, then \Psi is also a parallel transport of \psi along \eta\_{2}.

We leave this immediate proof to the reader.

###### Remark 3.7.

This result justifies that, when working on probability measures over \mathbb{R}^{d}, we can talk about a parallel transport \Psi of \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) along a coupling \gamma\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}) when (\pi\_{1})\_{\#}\gamma=\mu.

In general, there is no uniqueness of a parallel transport with our definition as the next example shows.

###### Example 3.8.

Let d=1 and \mu:=\delta\_{0}. Let \eta be given by \frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{\theta^{1}}+\delta\_{\theta^{2}}) where \theta^{i}(t)=2(\frac{3}{2}-i)t. Let \psi\_{0}=\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{0}+\delta\_{2}). Then the laws of the three following processes are all parallel transports of \psi along \eta,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \begin{cases}\{W(t)=(t,0),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{2},\\ \{W(t)=(-t,2),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{2},\end{cases}% \begin{cases}\{M(t)=(t,2),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{2},\\ \{M(t)=(-t,0),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{2},\end{cases} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \begin{cases}\{L(t)=(t,2),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{4},\\ \{L(t)=(t,0),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{4},\\ \{L(t)=(-t,0),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{4},\\ \{L(t)=(-t,2),t\in[0,1]\}\text{ with probability }\frac{1}{4}.\end{cases} |  |

This example shows that as soon as there are multiple ways to obtain our main coupling through the gluing Lemma in the proof of Proposition 3.4, there will be multiple parallel transports. On the converse, the next result shows that when one of the two couplings involved in the proof of Proposition 3.4 is deterministic, then there is a unique parallel transport. Similar remarks about the uniqueness of the law given by the gluing Lemma are of course already well-known, see for instance Lemma 5.3.2 in [2].

###### Proposition 3.9.

Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) and \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu. Assume that at least one of the two following statements holds.

* •

  The function \psi is of the form x\to\delta\_{v(x)} for some measurable v\in L^{2}\_{\mu}(\mathbb{R}^{d},\mathbb{R}^{d}).
* •

  There exists f\in L^{\infty}\_{t}(W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{d},\mathbb{R}^{d})) such that \eta is concentrated on curves \theta solutions of \theta^{\prime}(t)=f(t,\theta(t)).

Then, there exists a unique parallel transport of \psi along \eta.
