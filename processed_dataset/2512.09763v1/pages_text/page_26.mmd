with initial condition Y\_{0}, where \mathcal{T}^{\theta}(z) denotes the parallel transport of z along the path \theta and (\vartheta\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} is random process taking value in the set of geodesics of M, such that almost surely, for almost every t\in[0,1], \vartheta\_{t}(\omega) connects X\_{t}(\omega) to Y\_{t}(\omega). The main issue is that, there is no canonical way to choose \vartheta, even with the knowledge of \eta, contrary to the flat case. The possible multiplicity of geodesics then implies that the parallel transport of Z\_{t}(\omega) along these geodesics is not a Lipschitz function of Y\_{t}(\omega), which thus makes more challenging the resolution of (15).

We believe there are two main ways to tackle this problem. The first one is to prove existence of weaker notion of solution to (15), just as Theorem 7.1 provides a probabilistic solution to a singular ODE. The second one is to restrict our attention to cases in which X\_{t}(\omega) and Y\_{t}(\omega) are sufficiently close. Note that to prove Lipschitz estimates as in Theorem 7.13, we are mainly interested in \mu,\nu such that W\_{2}(\mu,\nu) is small, and, as is the distance gets smaller and smaller, the probability that a unique geodesic connects X\_{t}(\omega) and Y\_{t}(\omega) get closer to one as the points are getting closer to one another with larger and larger probability.

In any case, we leave this question for future research.

## Conclusions

We have presented another definition of the tangent space T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) than the one which is usually considered. It allowed us sufficient flexibility to tackle the different problems we were interested in. It seems that the only price to pay for such a generalization is the loss of uniqueness of several concepts (parallel transports or translated curves namely). We provided examples of non-uniqueness which highlight the fact that this non-uniqueness arise more from the nature of the space of probability measure than by something that we would have missed when defining T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})).

Several times, we made an crucial use of working at the level of \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) rather than at the one of \mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})), therefore adopting a Lagrangian point of view rather than an Eulerian one. This strategy, which is aligned with the lift on the space of random variables, seems to be quite fruitful. Without trying to diminish the obvious advantages of the Eulerian formulation (conciseness, numerical methods,…), we believe that for theoretical purposes, the Lagrangian formulation is quite often more helpful.
