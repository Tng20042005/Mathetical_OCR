Note that there are cases in which the W\_{2} distance between a curve and its translation actually decreases before increasing again, as the previous example showed. A less pathological example is the following.

###### Example 7.12.

Let m\_{t}:=\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{-4+3t}+\delta\_{4-3t}). It is clearly a solution of (8) for some smooth \alpha, constant in time, such that \alpha(x)=-3 if x\geq 1 and \alpha(x)=3 if x\leq-1. Let \gamma(dx,dy)=\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{-4}(dx)\delta\_{-1}(dy)+\delta\_{4}(dx)\delta\_%
{1}(dy)). It is clearly an optimal coupling for W\_{2} and one can check that \tilde{m}\_{t}:=\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{-1+3t}+\delta\_{1-3t}) is the unique translation of (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} along \gamma. Then

| --- | --- | --- |
|  | W^{2}\_{2}(m\_{t},\tilde{m}\_{t})=\begin{cases}9\text{ if }t\leq\frac{1}{3},\\ (5-6t)^{2}\text{ else.}\end{cases} |  |

This last example is yet another illustration (if it was still needed at this point) that the geometry of (\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}),W\_{2}) is not flat at all…

### 7.3. Applications in optimal control

Consider T>0, L:[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R%
}^{d})\to\mathbb{R}\_{+}, G:\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to\mathbb{R}\_{+} and the optimal control problem defined for all t\in[0,T],\bar{m}\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | V(t,\bar{m}):=\inf\_{(\alpha,m)}\left\{\int\_{t}^{T}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}L(s,x,% \alpha(s,x),m\_{s})m\_{s}(dx)ds+G(m\_{T})\right\}, |  |

where the infimum is taken over all pairs (\alpha,m) such that m:[t,T]\mapsto\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) is continuous, \alpha:[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) is measurable and they solve (8) with m\_{t}=\bar{m}. The function V is called the value function of the problem. Typically, some growth condition is assumed on L in its third argument, so that \alpha has to exhibit certain bounds. Quite often, those bounds are that for almost every s\in[t,T], \alpha\in L^{2}((\mathbb{R}^{d},m\_{s}),\mathbb{R}^{d}).

The interpretation of such a problem is that one can control the measure m through the continuity equation by choosing the speed \alpha. This interpretation has to be manipulated with care since, because no particular regularity condition on \alpha has been imposed, the continuity is not necessary uniquely solvable, thus the presence of m in the infimum as well (since, given an \alpha, multiple m can be solutions). We refer to [6] for more details on this kind of problem.

In view of [5] and the notion of parallel transport above, it may seem arbitrary to restrict ourselves to \alpha which are deterministic elements of the tangent space. Hence it is also natural to consider the following problem

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (14) |  | U(t,m):=\inf\_{(b,\mu,K)}\left\{\int\_{t}^{T}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{d}\times K}L(s,x,% b(s,x,k),(\pi\_{1})\_{\#}\mu\_{s})\mu\_{s}(dx,dk)ds+G(m\_{T})\right\}, |  |

where the infimum is taken over all (b,\mu,K) such that (13) is satisfied and such that (\pi\_{1})\_{\#}\mu\_{0}=m.

We always have U\leq V, and when L is convex in its third argument, we also have that V=U because of Jensen’s inequality and Remark 7.4. We focus in the rest of this section on U as we believe it is a more natural object, for essentially all the arguments we gave when choosing our tangent space above. Our main result on U is the following.
