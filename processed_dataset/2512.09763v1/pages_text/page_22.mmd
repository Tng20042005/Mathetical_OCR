###### Proposition 7.7.

Let (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} be a curve which can be represented through b,K,\mu as in Proposition 7.2. For any \gamma\_{0}\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{2d}) with (\pi\_{1})\_{\#}\gamma=m\_{0}, there exists an associated coupling curve, translating (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} along \gamma\_{0}. If (\gamma\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} is the translated pair, then C\_{2}(\gamma\_{t}) does not depend on time. More precisely, if (X\_{t},Y\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} is a process of law (\gamma\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]}. Then, almost surely, X\_{t}-Y\_{t} is constant in time.

###### Proof.

By the gluing Lemma, we can consider both a process (X\_{t}(\omega),k(\omega))\_{t\in[0,1]} of marginal law (\mu\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} on a probabilistic space (\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P}) such that, almost surely, X\_{t}=\int\_{0}^{t}b(s,X\_{s},k)ds+X\_{0}, and a random variable Y\_{0} such that (X\_{0},Y\_{0})\sim\gamma\_{0}. Define the process Y\_{t}=Y\_{0}+\int\_{0}^{t}b(s,X\_{s},k)ds. Setting \eta\_{t}:=\mathcal{L}(X\_{t},Y\_{t},k) completes the proof. The rest follows easily.
∎

Note that there is no uniqueness of such a procedure as the next example shows. This is mainly due to similar reasons as the non-uniqueness of parallel transport on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}).

###### Example 7.8.

For all t\in[0,1], define m\_{t}=\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{t}+\delta\_{-t}). Consider \gamma\_{0}(dx,dy)=\frac{1}{2}\delta\_{0}(dx)(\delta\_{-2}(dy)+\delta\_{2}(dy)). Remark that (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} is a solution of (8) with \alpha(t,x)=2\mathbb{1}\_{x\geq 0}-1. The three following trajectories are all translations of (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} along \gamma\_{0}

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \eta^{1}\_{t}=\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{-2-t}+\delta\_{2+t});\quad\eta^{2}\_{t}=\frac{1% }{2}(\delta\_{-2+t}+\delta\_{2-t});\quad\eta^{3}\_{t}=\frac{1}{4}(\delta\_{-2-t}+% \delta\_{2+t}+\delta\_{-2+t}+\delta\_{2-t}). |  |

As in the gluing Lemma, in certain ”deterministic” situations, we are able to obtain uniqueness of the translation in the sense that all possible translations yields the same translated curve.

###### Proposition 7.9.

Assume that (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} is a weak solution of (8) for some \alpha\in L^{1}((0,1),W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) and consider \tilde{m}\_{0}\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \gamma\_{0}\in\Pi(m\_{0},\tilde{m}\_{0}). Then, there is a unique translating coupling of (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} along \gamma\_{0}.

###### Proof.

The result is trivial, since, by standard Cauchy Lipschitz theory, the flow of the ODE is uniquely defined, there is thus no room for any non-uniqueness.
∎

###### Remark 7.10.

Note that we have here only an assumption on the regularity of the vector field, compared to the ”or” type of assumption of Proposition 3.9. This is due to the time dependent nature of the present problem. We leave as a simple exercise to the interested reader to establish that deterministic initial coupling is not sufficient, if the velocity field is not smooth, for instance by considering the case of the curve (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} given by m\_{t}=\frac{1}{2}(\delta\_{f(t)}+\delta\_{-f(t)}) where f(t)=\max(-\frac{1}{2}-t;0;-\frac{1}{2}+t).

This translation enjoys several other properties.

###### Proposition 7.11.

The following hold.

1. (i)

   Let (x\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} be a \mathcal{C}^{1} curve on \mathbb{R}^{d}, \gamma(dx,dy)=\delta\_{x\_{0}}(dx)\delta\_{y\_{0}}(dy) for some y\_{0}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}. Then the translation of (\delta\_{x\_{t}})\_{t\in[0,1]} along \gamma is given by (\delta\_{y\_{t}})\_{t\in[0,1]}.
2. (ii)

   Let (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} be a curve as in Proposition 7.7 and \gamma some optimal coupling for W\_{2} whose first marginal is m\_{0}. Let \tilde{m}\_{t} be a translation of (m\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} along \gamma. Then t\mapsto W\_{2}(m\_{t},\tilde{m}\_{t}) is bounded by C\_{2}(\gamma).

###### Proof.

For the first point, it suffices to remark that there is a unique possible translated curve. The second point follows directly from point (v) in Proposition 7.7.
