Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}(M), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}(M)) and \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],M)), concentrated on C^{1} curves and such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu. A parallel transport of \psi along \eta is a measure \Psi\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],TM)) concentrated on C^{1} curves such that

* •

  (p\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi=\eta.
* •

  \Psi is concentrated on parallel transports on M.
* •

  (e\_{0})\_{\#}\Psi(dx,dz)=\mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz).

Once again, similar results as in the \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) case hold and their proof are similar so we do not give them, except for the following integrability and existence results.

###### Proposition 5.3.

Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}(M), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}(M)) and \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],M)), concentrated on C^{1} curves, such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu and \Psi a parallel transport of \psi along \eta. Then, for any t\in[0,1], (e\_{t})\_{\#}\Psi\in\mathcal{P}\_{1}(TM).

###### Proof.

Since parallel transport on M preserves the norm, if we consider a process (X\_{t},Z\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} of law \Psi, we obtain that almost surely t\mapsto|Z\_{t}|\_{X\_{t}} is constant in [0,1]. Hence, the result follows by taking the expectation of this quantity.
∎

###### Proposition 5.4.

Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}(M), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}(M)) and \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],M)), concentrated on C^{1} curves and such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu. There exists a parallel transport of \psi along \eta.

###### Proof.

Once again, existence relies on the gluing Lemma, which we use to get the existence of a probability measure \Gamma(dx,dp,d\theta)\in\mathcal{P}(M\times TM\times\mathcal{C}([0,1],M)) such that (\pi\_{3})\_{\#}\Gamma=\eta, (\pi\_{1},\pi\_{2})\_{\#}\Gamma=\mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz) and (\pi\_{1},e\_{0}\circ\pi\_{3})\_{\#}\Gamma=(Id,Id)\_{\#}\mu. Then, (\tau\_{\pi\_{3}}(\pi\_{2}))\_{\#}\Gamma is a required parallel transport.
∎

###### Remark 5.5.

In order to use the notion of parallel transport on M, we need to restrict ourselves to \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],M)) being supported on C^{1} curves. Recall that parallel transport on M cannot be defined along a curve which is simply continuous. Note finally that this regularity shall not guarantee the uniqueness of parallel transport on \mathcal{P}(M), see Example 3.8 which can be adapted to this case for instance.

## 6. Comparing elements in different tangent spaces and regularity of elements of \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{O})\to\mathbb{R}

One of the main advantages of parallel transport is that it allows to compare elements in different tangent spaces, namely by parallel transporting one into the tangent space of the other, usually along a geodesic. We explain here how such an idea can be used to define regularity classes for functions U:\mathcal{P}\to\mathbb{R}. In particular, we are interested in \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha} spaces, that is in the regularity of the differential, which is naturally an element of the tangent space. For the sake of clarity, we restrict ourselves to the case of \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) here, and discuss extensions at the end of the section.

We organise our results as follows. We start by introducing a natural notion of distance on the tangent space T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) for some fixed \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) and show how, with the help of parallel transport, we can construct a way of comparing elements in different tangent spaces. We then proceed by giving another natural way of comparing elements in different tangent spaces, by equipping T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}):=\cup\_{\mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})}%
\{\mu\}\times T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) with a distance directly, commenting on the links with the first approach. We then proceed to define regularity spaces for functions \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to\mathbb{R}.

The first steps of our program are clearly aligned with basic objects in differential geometry such as metric on both the base space and the tangent bundle (or sheaf here).
