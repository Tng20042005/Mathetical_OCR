###### Proof.

Consider two parallel transport \Psi\_{1} and \Psi\_{2} of \psi along \eta, and two processes (X^{1},Z^{1}),(X^{2},Z^{2}) of respective law \Psi\_{1} and \Psi\_{2}.

In the first case, we find that for i=1,2, the process (X^{i},Z^{i}) is of the form (X^{i}\_{t},v(X^{i}\_{0}))\_{t\in[0,1]}. Since X^{1} and X^{2} both have law \eta, it follows that \Psi\_{1}=\Psi\_{2}.

In the second case, since the flow \phi:[0,1]\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}^{d} associated to the ODE \theta^{\prime}(t)=f(t,\theta(t)) is well defined, it follows that X^{i} is of the form (\phi(t,X^{i}\_{0}))\_{t\in[0,1]}. Hence, for i=1,2, the process (X^{i},Z^{i}) is of the form ((\phi(t,X^{i}\_{0}),Z^{i}))\_{t\in[0,1]}. Since (X^{1}\_{0},Z^{1}) and (X^{2}\_{0},Z^{2}) have law \mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz), it also follows that \Psi\_{1}=\Psi\_{2}.
∎

###### Remark 3.10.

More general condition on \eta are sufficient. In fact, it suffices in this case, that \eta is concentrated on curves \theta such that there exists a measurable map T:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}^{d} such that \theta(1)=T(\theta(0)).

Since parallel transport is uniquely defined when we start from a deterministic element of the tangent space, one might wonder why bother with the ”extended” tangent space that we proposed. The next example shows that, even if we start with a deterministic element of the tangent space, and thus that the parallel transport is uniquely defined, the transported element might end up being a non-deterministic element of the tangent space at the final point.

###### Example 3.11.

Let d=1, \mu be the normal distribution and \psi:x\to\delta\_{x}\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R})). Let \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R})) be given by the coupling \mu(dx)\delta\_{0}(dy). Then, the (unique) parallel transport \Psi of \psi along \eta is such that (e\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi(dx,dz)=\delta\_{0}(dx)\mu(dz). In particular, the associated element \psi^{\prime}\in T\_{\delta\_{0}}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R})) is not deterministic, as it associates \mu to the point 0.

We also have the following obvious time reversibility of parallel transports.

###### Proposition 3.12.

Let \tau(\theta) be the reverse parametrization by time of a curve \theta\in\mathcal{C}([0,1],X) for some topological space X, i.e. \tau(\theta)(t)=\theta(1-t).

If \Psi is a parallel transport along \eta, then \tau\_{\#}\Psi is a parallel transport along \tau\_{\#}\eta.

Finally, we present another example to highlight the fact that our notion of parallel transport indeed depends on the Lagrangian path.

###### Example 3.13.

Let \mu be the uniform distribution on [0,1], and consider \psi:x\to\delta\_{x}\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})). Let U be a random variable of law \mu, \eta\_{1}:=\mathcal{L}((U)\_{t\in[0,1]}) and \eta\_{2}=\mathcal{L}((tU+(1-t)(1-U))\_{t\in[0,1]}). Then, for all t\in[0,1],(e\_{t})\_{\#}\eta\_{1}=(e\_{t})\_{\#}\eta\_{2}, however, the parallel transport of \psi along \eta\_{1} and \eta\_{2} are clearly different.

### 3.4. The case of \mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})

The extension of the above to \mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) does not raise any particular difficulty, mainly because the integrability conditions follows from the definition, as Proposition 3.3 shows. Hence, we do not give more details here.

### 3.5. Link with a previous notion of parallel transport on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})

In [1, 18], the authors introduced another notion of parallel transport on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) (and in fact on the space of probability measure over a manifold as well) that we do not present in full details, but rather give our interpretation of it, in order to compare it with our notion.
