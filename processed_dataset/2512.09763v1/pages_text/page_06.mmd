The first application of our concept of tangent space is to define a notion of parallel transport on \mathcal{P}\_{p}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). The notion of parallel transport usually requires three main concepts such as: tangent spaces (or more generally vector fields), a notion of smooth curves, and a notion of derivative along a smooth curve \theta. A parallel transport is then defined as a curve valued in the tangent space over the curve \theta whose derivative in the direction that follows \theta is 0. We make precise such an idea below.

We shall first present the notion of smooth curves along which are going to parallel transport our vectors. As the geometry of \mathbb{R}^{d} is euclidean, the notion of derivative along a curve shall be quite trivial. The case of \mathcal{P}(M) treated below will require some care in this aspect. Furthermore, we restrict the following to the case p=2 to lighten notation and comment at the end of this section on the case p\neq 2.

We finish this section by comparing our notion to the one introduced and studied in [1].

### 3.1. Smooth curves

A curve on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) is typically a map \theta:[0,1]\to\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}). Saying that a curve is continuous or Lipschitz is clear in this setting. We want to consider curves which are more regular than simply Lipschitz. Since \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) is not a proper normed vector space, there is no intrinsic way to do so and we explain below the underlying difficulties and the choice we make.

#### 3.1.1. What we do not do

Given the nature of \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), it is not obvious how to define C^{1} curves. For instance, we could understand curves \theta satisfying \theta^{\prime}(t)=cst, when embedding \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) in the space of signed measures equipped with total variation. But by doing so we would miss curves of the form (\delta\_{x(t)})\_{t\in[0,1]} for (x(t))\_{t\in[0,1]}, a smooth curve on \mathbb{R}^{d}. The latter type of curve is typically characterized by being the unique solution of equations of the form

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3) |  | \partial\_{t}m+\text{div}\_{x}(\phi(t,x)m)=0\text{ on }(0,1)\times\mathbb{R}^{d}, |  |

where \text{div}\_{x} is the divergence operator on \mathbb{R}^{d} and \phi:[0,1]\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}^{d} is a smooth vector field, Lipschitz in x, say uniformly in t. However, restricting our attention to this type of curves would make us miss the geodesics of the distance W\_{2}, which are typically characterized as being the solution of such equations for non-smooth functions \phi. The latter makes the discussion about what is a smooth curve quite complex, thus we do not adopt this point of view here.

#### 3.1.2. What we do

We take a so-called Lagrangian point of view and consider more general curves \theta on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), namely one which are of the form \theta(t)=(e\_{t})\_{\#}\eta for some \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})), where e\_{t}(f)=f(t), for f\in\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d}), i.e. e\_{t} is the evaluation mapping at time t. We say that \eta is \mathcal{C}^{1} if it is concentrated on \mathcal{C}^{1} curves. Such a notion of regularity does not naturally translate to a regularity for \theta, for instance because of the clear multiplicity of \eta which generate the same \theta.

In fact, through Ambrosio’s superposition principle which is presented in details in Section 7, there is a correspondance between this Lagrangian point of view and the previous Eulerian one. It just happens that the Lagrangian point of view is much more convenient for what follows.

### 3.2. Vector fields and their derivatives

A vector field above \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) is typically a map V defined on \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) such that V(\mu)\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) for all \mu. To define parallel transport, we are interested in vector field along a curve, which we decided to be given by a Lagrangian formulation, hence we shall naturally be interested in Lagrangian vector field.
