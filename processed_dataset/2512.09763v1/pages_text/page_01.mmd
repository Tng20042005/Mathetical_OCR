###### Abstract.

We propose a new notion of the *formal* tangent space to the Wasserstein space \mathcal{P}(X) at a given measure. Modulo an integrability condition, we say that this tangent space is made of functions over X which are valued in the probability measures over the tangent bundle to X. This generalization of previous concepts of tangent spaces allows us to define appropriate notions of parallel transport, \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha} regularity over \mathcal{P}(X) and translation of a curve over \mathcal{P}(X).

## Introduction

We introduce a new notion of tangent space to the space of probability measures over different finite dimensional metric sets, when it is equipped with a Wasserstein metric (i.e. a Wasserstein space). This notion is more general than the one previously considered in the literature in the sense that it contains strictly more elements. Our notion basically sees elements in the tangent space as measured valued functions, instead of simply functions, in the same spirit as the famous relaxations of either Young or Kantorovich.

We then proceed by using this point of view to define a notion of parallel transport on the space of probability measures (Section 3). Later, we build on this notion of parallel transport to define \mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha} spaces of real valued functions over the space of probability measures equipped with Wasserstein metrics (Section 6). We finally use a similar point of view to explain how we can translate curves and how it is helpful in optimal control (Section 7).
