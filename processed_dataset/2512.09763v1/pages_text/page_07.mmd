A vector field along a Lagrangian curve \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) is a probability measure \Psi\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}[0,1],\mathbb{R}^{2d}) such that (p\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi=\eta, where p\_{1}:\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{2d})\to\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d}) is defined by p\_{1}(z)(t)=(\pi\_{1})(z(t)). If \Psi is concentrated along smooth curves in \mathbb{R}^{2d}, its derivative along (p\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi is by definition the curve (\partial\_{2})\_{\#}\Psi where \partial\_{2}:\mathcal{C}^{1}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{2d})\to\mathcal{C}([0,1],%
\mathbb{R}^{d}) is defined by \partial\_{2}(z)(t)=\frac{d}{dt}(\pi\_{2}(z(t))). More generally, \partial\_{2} is well defined on curves on \mathbb{R}^{2d} such that the second component is in \mathcal{C}^{1}. Such a space is denoted \mathcal{C}\_{y}^{1}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{2d}).

### 3.3. Main definition and properties

Since the geometry of \mathbb{R}^{d} is rather trivial, the parallel transport in \mathbb{R}^{d} simply consists in translating the tangent vector. At the level of \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), this simplicity translates into the following definition.

###### Definition 3.1.

Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) and \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu. A parallel transport of \psi along \eta is a measure \Psi\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{2d})) concentrated on \mathcal{C}^{1}\_{y}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{2d}) such that

* •

  (p\_{1})\_{\#}\Psi=\eta,
* •

  (\partial\_{2})\_{\#}\Psi=\delta\_{0},
* •

  (e\_{0})\_{\#}\Psi(dx,dz)=\mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz).

###### Remark 3.2.

Remark that no integrability condition is required here, as it follows from the definition as the next result shows.

The following result makes transparent that a parallel transport yields a curve in the tangent sheaf T\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}).

###### Proposition 3.3.

Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})), \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu and \Psi a parallel transport of \psi along \eta. Then, for all t\in[0,1], (e\_{t})\_{\#}\Psi=(e\_{t})\_{\#}\eta(dx)\psi\_{t,x}(dz) for some \psi\_{t}\in T\_{(e\_{t})\_{\#}\eta}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})).

###### Proof.

Let (X,Z) be a process of law \Psi. For t\in[0,1], (X\_{t},Z\_{t}) is such that \mathcal{L}(X\_{t})=(e\_{t})\_{\#}\eta. Moreover, since Z\_{t}=Z\_{0} and that \mathcal{L}(Z\_{0})\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}) since \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})), the result follows.
∎

The existence of parallel transport is proved next to be a simple consequence of the gluing Lemma.

###### Proposition 3.4.

Let \mu\in\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), \psi\in T\_{\mu}(\mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})) and \eta\in\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})) such that (e\_{0})\_{\#}\eta=\mu. There exists a parallel transport of \psi along \eta.

###### Proof.

By gluing together (e\_{0},Id)\_{\#}\eta(d\theta) and \mu(dx)\psi\_{x}(dz) along their first coordinate, we obtain a probability measure \Gamma(dx,d\theta,dz). Consider the map \mathcal{T}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{d})\times\mathbb%
{R}^{d}\to\mathcal{C}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^{2d}),(x,\theta,z)\to(t\to(\theta(t),z)). The probability \mathcal{T}\_{\#}\Gamma is a required parallel transport.
∎

The next example shows what parallel transport is along curves which are simply constructed by interpolation of a coupling between two measures. In particular, such curves model all geodesics in \mathcal{P}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d}).
