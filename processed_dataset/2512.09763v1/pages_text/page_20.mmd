Since we saw that the parallel transport of a deterministic element of the tangent space may fail to be deterministic, we want to consider an analogous of the previous approach for general elements of the tangent space.

This objective puts us into the territory of a quite usual problem in stochastic control: how to generate sufficient noise ? In other words, if we consider general controls \psi:[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), can we consider a natural associated evolution (m\_{t}(dx)\psi\_{t,x}(dz))\_{t\in[0,1]} such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{0}^{1}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}}|z|^{2}\psi\_{s,x}(dz)m\_{s% }(dx)ds<\infty\quad? |  |

The answer to this question is no in general. Consider for instance an hypothetical case in which, for all t\geq 0, m\_{t}(dx)\psi\_{t,x}(dz)=m\_{t}(dx)\rho(dz) for \rho the normal distribution. This would correspond to a situation in which, at any time, we are able to randomize the speed of the particles, independently of their current position, hence of what has been done before. The natural such candidate would be given by a process (X\_{t},Z\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} where \mathcal{L}((X\_{t},Z\_{t}))=m\_{t}(dx)\rho(dz) and X\_{t}=X\_{0}+\int\_{0}^{t}Z\_{s}ds. We do not know how to construct such a process. On the other hand, we can characterize situations which we can represent as the next result shows.

###### Proposition 7.2.

Let (X\_{t},Z\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} be a \mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{d} process such that,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{0}^{1}\mathbb{E}[|Z\_{t}|^{2}]dt<\infty |  |

and, almost surely, for all t\in[0,1]

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (11) |  | X\_{t}=X\_{0}+\int\_{0}^{t}Z\_{s}ds. |  |

Then, there exists a probabilistic space K\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}, a measurable map b:[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\times K\to\mathbb{R}^{d} and a continuous path (\mu\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]}, valued in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d}\times K) such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (12) |  | ((\pi\_{1},b(t,\pi\_{1},\pi\_{2})\_{\#}\mu\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]}=(\mathcal{L}(X\_{t},Z\_{% t})\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} |  |

and (\mu,b) is a weak solution of the continuity equation

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (13) |  | \partial\_{t}\mu+\text{div}\_{x}(b\mu)=0\text{ in }(0,1)\times\mathbb{R}^{d}% \times K, |  |

with initial condition \mu\_{0} such that (\pi\_{1})\_{\#}\mu\_{0}=\mathcal{L}(X\_{0}).
Conversely, given a probabilistic set (K\subset\mathbb{R}^{N},\mathcal{B},\mathbb{P}^{\prime}) and a solution (\mu,b) of (13) satisfying

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{0}^{1}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{d}\times K}|b(t,x,k)|^{2}\mu\_{t}(dx,dk)dt<\infty, |  |

there exists a process (X\_{t},Z\_{t})\_{t\in[0,1]} such that (12) and (11) hold.
