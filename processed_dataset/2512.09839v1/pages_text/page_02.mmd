In [Dav24], we studied quantitative unique continuation at infinity for real-valued solutions to (1.1) when n=2 and the potential exhibits growth at infinity, i.e., \left|V(z)\right|\lesssim\left|z\right|^{N} for N>0.
The techniques in that article rely heavily on the ideas in [LMNN20] and careful scaling arguments.
Here, we address the more difficult setting where the potential exhibits decay at infinity.
The precise statement of the main theorem is as follows.

###### Theorem 1 (Main Theorem).

For some a\_{0}\geq 1 and N\in(0,2), let V:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R} satisfy

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.3) |  | \left|V(w)\right|\leq a\_{0}^{2}\left<w\right>^{-N}. |  |

Assume that u:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R} is a solution to

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.4) |  | -\Delta u+Vu=0\,\text{ in }\mathbb{R}^{2} |  |

with the properties that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.5) |  | \left|u(0)\right|=1 |  |

and for each w\in\mathbb{R}^{2},

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.6) |  | \left|u(w)\right|\leq\exp\left(c\_{0}\left|w\right|^{1-\frac{N}{2}}\right). |  |

For every \varepsilon\in\left(0,\frac{N}{2}\right), there exists {R}\_{0}(N,a\_{0},c\_{0},\varepsilon)>0 so that whenever R\geq{R}\_{0}, it holds that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.7) |  | \inf\_{\left|w\_{0}\right|=R}\left\|u\right\|\_{L^{\infty}\left(B\_{1}(w\_{0})% \right)}\geq\exp\left(-R^{1-\frac{N}{2}+\varepsilon}\right). |  |

The results of [Dav14] prove an estimate of the form (1.2) with \beta=\frac{4-2N}{3}=\frac{4}{3}\left(1-\frac{N}{2}\right)>1-\frac{N}{2}+\varepsilon.
In that article, the assumptions are the same as those in Theorem 1, except that u may be complex-valued.
Thus, as in the case of bounded V, Theorem 1 illustrates that better estimates hold in the real-valued planar setting.

As illustrated by the following example, Theorem 1 is sharp (up to \varepsilon) for all N\in(0,2).
Fix N\in(0,2), then set u(z)=\exp\left(-\left|z\right|^{1-\frac{N}{2}}\right).
A computation shows that u satisfies (1.4) where

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | V(z):=\left(1-\frac{N}{2}\right)^{2}\left(\left|z\right|^{1-\frac{N}{2}}-1% \right)\left|z\right|^{-1-\frac{N}{2}} |  |

satisfies \left|V(z)\right|\lesssim\left|z\right|^{-N}.
On the other hand, for any \beta>0, with u(z)=\left|z\right|^{-\beta} on \left|z\right|>1, we see that \displaystyle\Delta u=\beta^{2}\left|z\right|^{-\beta-2} and therefore u satisfies (1.4) on an exterior domain with V(z):=\beta^{2}\left|z\right|^{-2}.
In particular, we may not have exponential behavior when V decays fast enough, which explains why we restrict ourselves to N<2.

To prove Theorem 1, we use an iterative argument that is reminiscent of the one in [Dav14], see also [LW14, DKW19, Dav20a, Dav25].
To initialize the iteration, we apply a quantitative estimate of the form (1.2) with \beta=1.
This result, which verifies Landis’ conjecture in the real-valued planar setting, was originally proved by Logunov, Malinnikova, Nadirashvili, and Nazarov in [LMNN20], and we formulate it in Theorem 3 below.
The iteration argument then relies on repeated applications of Proposition 2 which is proved using the ideas from [LMNN20].
Roughly speaking, Proposition 2 shows that if an estimate like (1.2) holds with \beta=\beta\_{0}, then for some x\_{1} with \left|x\_{1}\right|\gg\left|x\_{0}\right|, another estimate like (1.2) holds with x\_{0} replaced by x\_{1} and \beta=\beta\_{1}\in\left[1,\beta\_{0}\right].
When \beta\_{0}=1, Proposition 2 isn’t useful, but when \beta\_{0}>1, we can decrease the exponent, i.e., make \beta\_{1}<\beta\_{0}.
Therefore, to benefit from the iteration argument, we need to transform to a situation where \beta\_{0}>1.
We observe that if u is composed with the real-variable version of the conformal transformation z\mapsto z^{\alpha}, then the new function also satisfies a Schrödinger equation.
By choosing \alpha>1 appropriately, we can ensure that the new potential function is bounded and that the new solution function satisfies a version of (1.2) with \beta>1.
By repeatedly applying Proposition 2 to the transformed equation, we can make \beta arbitrarily close to 1.
Finally, to reach the conclusion, we undo the change of variables.

We use the notation B\_{r}(z) to denote a ball of radius r>0 centered at the point z, abbreviated by B\_{r} when the center is clear.
Generic constants are denoted by c,C and may change from line to line without comment.
Specific constants will be indicated by subscripts.

The article is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we present a unique continuation theorem for harmonic functions in punctured domains.
The content of this section is very similar to [LMNN20, Section 5] and [Dav24, Section 2].
The iterative result described by Proposition 2 is the content of Section 3.
Proposition 2 is a three-ball inequality for solutions to Schrödinger equations and its proof relies on the results from Section 2. In Section 4, we introduce the real-valued versions of z\mapsto z^{\alpha} and record some of their properties.
In particular, we show how solutions behave when they are composed with these transformations.
Finally, the proof of Theorem 1 is presented in Section 5.

## 2. Decay properties of harmonic functions in punctured domains

In this section, we present and prove quantitative unique continuation results (in the form of three-ball inequalities) for harmonic functions in punctured domains.
We recall the following application of the Harnack inequality which appears in [LMNN20, Claim 5.2] and is repeated in [Dav24, Lemma 2.1].
