| (2.7) |  | \displaystyle\sup\_{\Omega}\left|f\right|\geq\sup\_{\Omega\_{1}}\left|f\right|% \geq\sup\_{\Omega\_{1}}\left|\nabla h\right|T^{-k}\geq\frac{1}{8R}T^{-k}. |  |

An application of (2.5) shows that

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.8) |  | \displaystyle\max\_{W\_{1}}\left|f\right| | \displaystyle\leq\max\_{W\_{1}}\left|\nabla h\right|\left(\frac{2}{r}\right)^{k}% \leq\left(\frac{16r}{R}\right)^{2k}\left(\frac{2}{r}\right)^{k}=\left(\frac{2^% {9}r}{R}\right)^{k}R^{-k}<2^{-k}R^{-k}, |  |

where we have used that \frac{R}{r}>2^{10}.
Since k\geq 2C\_{H}R\geq 20R, then 2^{-k}<\frac{1}{8R}.
In particular, by combining (2.8) with (2.7), we deduce that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\max\_{W\_{1}}\left|f\right|<\frac{1}{8R}T^{-k}\leq\sup\_{\Omega}% \left|f\right|. |  |

An application of (2.6) shows that

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.9) |  | \displaystyle\max\_{W\_{2}}\left|f\right| | \displaystyle\leq\max\_{W\_{2}}\left|\nabla h\right|\left(R-7\right)^{-k}\leq 2e% ^{M}\left(\frac{R-\frac{S}{32}}{R-7}\right)^{k}T^{-k}. |  |

Now

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.10) |  | \displaystyle 2e^{M}\left(\frac{R-\frac{S}{32}}{R-7}\right)^{k}<\frac{1}{8R} | \displaystyle\iff k\log\left(\frac{R-7}{R-\frac{S}{32}}\right)>M+\log\left(16R% \right). |  |

Since S\geq 2^{8}, then \frac{S}{32}-7\geq\frac{S}{2^{8}} and we see that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\log\left(\frac{R-7}{R-\frac{S}{32}}\right) | \displaystyle=\log\left(1+\frac{\frac{S}{32}-7}{R-\frac{S}{32}}\right)\geq\log% \left(1+\frac{S}{2^{8}R}\right)\geq\frac{S}{2^{8}R}\left(1-\frac{S}{2^{9}R}% \right). |  |

As S\leq\frac{R}{2}, then 1-\frac{S}{2^{9}R}\geq 1-2^{-10}>\frac{1}{2} and we deduce that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \log\left(\frac{R-7}{R-\frac{S}{32}}\right)>\frac{S}{2^{9}R}. |  |

Since \displaystyle k\geq 2^{10}MRS^{-1}, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \frac{k}{2}\log\left(\frac{R-7}{R-\frac{S}{32}}\right)>M>\log\left(16R\right), |  |

where the second inequality is by assumption. Therefore, (2.10) holds.
Combining (2.10) with (2.9) and (2.7) shows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\max\_{W\_{2}}\left|f\right|<\sup\_{\Omega}\left|f\right|. |  |

Since f is a holomorphic function in \Omega, then the maximum principle guarantees that \displaystyle\sup\_{\Omega}\left|f\right|=\sup\_{\partial\Omega}\left|f\right|.
As shown above, the maximum doesn’t occur on W\_{1} or W\_{2}, so there must exist a disk 3D\_{j}\subset\left\{\frac{r}{2}<\left|z\right|<R-1\right\} for which \displaystyle\sup\_{\Omega}\left|f\right|=\sup\_{\partial\left(3D\_{j}\right)}%
\left|f\right|.
