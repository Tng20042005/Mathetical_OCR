Figure 2. A possible image of W\_{2} with case (a) illustrated by the points z\_{a\_{1}} and z\_{a\_{2}}, and case (b) illustrated by z\_{b}.

Case (a): Since h doesn’t change sign in B\_{1}(z), then an application of [HL11, Lemma 1.10] shows that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left|\nabla h(z)\right| | \displaystyle\leq 2\left|h(z)\right|\leq 2\sup\_{B\_{R}\setminus\bigcup 3D\_{j}}% \left|h\right|\leq 2e^{M}, |  |

where we have applied (2.1).
  
Case (b): Since B\_{1}(z)\subset B\_{R}\setminus\bigcup 3D\_{j}, then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left|\nabla h(z)\right| | \displaystyle\leq 2\sup\_{B\_{1}\left(z\right)}\left|h\right|\leq 2\sup\_{B\_{R}% \setminus\bigcup 3D\_{j}}\left|h\right|\leq 2e^{M}. |  |

By combining both cases, we see that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.6) |  | \sup\_{W\_{2}}\left|h\right|\leq e^{M},\;\sup\_{W\_{2}}\left|\nabla h\right|\leq 2% e^{M}. |  |

We now use these estimates on h from above to understand the behavior of the analytic function \displaystyle f=\frac{h\_{x}-ih\_{y}}{z^{k}}.
Define the set \Omega\_{1}\subset\Omega as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Omega\_{1}:=\left\{\frac{r}{2}<\left|z\right|<T\right\}\setminus\bigcup 3D\_{j}. |  |

Using containment, assumption (2.4), and our normalization (2.3), we see that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\sup\_{B\_{\frac{r}{2}}\setminus\bigcup 3D\_{j}}\left|h\right|\leq% \sup\_{B\_{r}\setminus\bigcup 3D\_{j}}\left|h\right|\leq\left(\frac{16r}{R}\right% )^{3k}<1=\sup\_{B\_{T}\setminus\bigcup 3D\_{j}}\left|h\right|. |  |

Therefore, there exists z\_{0}\in\Omega\_{1} for which \left|h(z\_{0})\right|=1.
By (2.5), we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\sup\_{W\_{1}}\left|h\right|\leq\left(\frac{16r}{R}\right)^{2k}<% \frac{1}{2}, |  |

so there exists z\_{1}\in W\_{1} for which \left|h(z\_{1})\right|=\alpha<\frac{1}{2}.
Let \Gamma be a path in \Omega\_{1} from z\_{0} to z\_{1} for which \ell\left(\Gamma\right)\leq 4R.
If we assume that \left|\nabla h(z)\right|<\frac{1}{8R} for all z\in\Gamma, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\frac{1}{2}<\left|h(z\_{1})-h(z\_{0})\right|=\left|\int\_{\Gamma}% \nabla h(w)\cdot dw\right|\leq\int\_{\Gamma}\left|\nabla h(w)\right|\left|dw% \right|<\frac{1}{8R}\ell\left(\Gamma\right)<\frac{1}{2}, |  |

which is impossible so it follows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\sup\_{\Omega}\left|\nabla h\right|\geq\sup\_{\Omega\_{1}}\left|% \nabla h\right|\geq\frac{1}{8R}. |  |

Therefore,
