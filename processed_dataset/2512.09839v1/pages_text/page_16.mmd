The bound in (1.6) shows that \displaystyle\left|v(z)\right|=\left|u(T\_{\alpha}(z))\right|\leq\exp\left(c\_{0%
}\left|z\right|^{\alpha\left(1-\frac{N}{2}\right)}\right)=\exp\left(c\_{0}\left%
|z\right|\right) from which it follows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left\|v\right\|\_{L^{\infty}\left(B\_{R\_{k}}(z\_{k})\right)}\leq% \exp\left(c\_{0}\left(\left|z\_{k}\right|+R\_{k}\right)\right)\leq\exp\left(\frac% {5c\_{0}}{2}R\_{k}\right). |  |

Let W:\mathbb{R}^{2}\_{+}\to\mathbb{R} be given by W(z)=\alpha^{2}\left|z\right|^{2\alpha-2}V(T\_{\alpha}(z))=\alpha^{2}\left|w%
\right|^{2-\frac{2}{\alpha}}V(w) so that by (1.3),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left|W(z)\right|=\alpha^{2}\left|w\right|^{2-\frac{2}{\alpha}}% \left|V(w)\right|\leq a\_{0}^{2}\alpha^{2}\left|w\right|^{2-N-\frac{2}{\alpha}}% =\left(a\_{0}\alpha\right)^{2}. |  |

An application of Lemma 2 with assumption (1.4) shows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | -\Delta v+Wv=0\;\text{ in }\mathbb{R}^{2}\_{+}. |  |

As R\_{k}\geq\bar{r}\_{1} implies that R\_{k}\geq\hat{R}\_{0}(a\_{0}\alpha) and S\_{k}\in\left(2^{8},\frac{R\_{k}}{2}\right), Proposition 2 is applicable with a=a\_{0}\alpha, R=R\_{k}, S=S\_{k}, L=R\_{k}, and c\_{1}=\frac{5c\_{0}}{2}.
With r=1, Proposition 2 shows that

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.9) |  | \displaystyle\left\|v\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{1}(z\_{k}))} | \displaystyle\geq\exp\left(-\tau\_{k}(R\_{k})\log R\_{k}\right), |  |

where

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.10) |  | \displaystyle\tau\_{k}(R\_{k}) | \displaystyle=\max\left\{3a\_{0}\alpha C\_{H}\sqrt{\frac{C\_{K}}{32\ln 2}}R\_{k}% \sqrt{\log R\_{k}},2^{15}\left(\frac{5c\_{0}}{2}+1+\frac{c\_{d}}{R\_{k}\log R\_{k}}% \right)R\_{k}^{2-\frac{1}{\alpha\_{k-1}+\delta}}\right\} |  |
|  |  | \displaystyle+\frac{1}{5}\left(R\_{k}+\frac{c\_{d}}{\log R\_{k}}\right). |  |

Because R\_{k}\geq\bar{r}\_{1} and \alpha\_{k-1}>1, conditions (5.3) and (5.4) imply that

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.11) |  | \displaystyle\tau\_{k}(R\_{k}) | \displaystyle\leq\left[2^{14}\left(5c\_{0}+4\right)+\frac{2}{5}\right]R\_{k}^{2-% \frac{1}{\alpha\_{k-1}+\delta}} |  |

while condition (5.5) implies that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left[2^{14}\left(5c\_{0}+4\right)+\frac{2}{5}\right]\log R\_{k}\leq R\_{k}^{% \frac{\delta^{2}}{2}}. |  |

Since \alpha>1 and \delta\leq 1 implies that 2-\frac{1}{\alpha+\delta}+\frac{\delta^{2}}{2}<2-\frac{1}{\alpha}+\delta, then combining these bounds shows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \tau\_{k}(R\_{k})\log R\_{k}\leq R\_{k}^{2-\frac{1}{\alpha\_{k-1}}+\delta}=R\_{k}^{% \alpha\_{k}+\delta}. |  |

Returning to (5.9), we conclude that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left\|v\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{1}(z\_{k}))} | \displaystyle\geq\exp\left(-R\_{k}^{\alpha\_{k}+\delta}\right)\geq\exp\left(-% \left|z\_{k}\right|^{\alpha\_{k}+\delta}\right), |  |

establishing the claim given by (5.8).

Next we consider the behavior of v on a ball centered at z\_{\ell}.
The arguments in the previous paragraph show that Proposition 2 is applicable with a=a\_{0}\alpha, R=R\_{\ell}, S=S\_{\ell}, L=R\_{\ell}, and c\_{1}=\frac{5c\_{0}}{2}.
In particular, with \displaystyle r=\tilde{r}:=\frac{\left|z\_{\ell}\right|^{1-\alpha}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}, Proposition 2 shows that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left\|v\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{\ell}))} | \displaystyle\geq\left(\frac{\tilde{r}}{R\_{\ell}}\right)^{\tau\_{\ell}(R\_{\ell}% )}, |  |

where \tau\_{\ell}(R\_{\ell}) is defined by (5.10) and the bound in (5.11) holds.
Because R\_{\ell}<\left|z\_{\ell}\right|<\frac{3}{2}R\_{\ell}, then \frac{R\_{\ell}}{\tilde{r}}<\frac{4\alpha}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{3}{2}R\_{\ell}%
\right)^{\alpha} and condition (5.6) implies that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left[2^{14}\left(5c\_{0}+4\right)+\frac{2}{5}\right]\log\left(\frac{R\_{\ell}}{% \tilde{r}}\right)\leq R\_{\ell}^{\frac{5\delta^{2}}{6}}. |  |

Since \alpha\_{\ell-1}>1+\delta and \delta\leq 1 implies that 2-\frac{1}{\alpha\_{\ell-1}+\delta}+\frac{5\delta^{2}}{6}<\alpha\_{\ell}+\delta%
\leq 1+2\delta, then \tau\_{\ell}(R\_{\ell})\log\left(\frac{R\_{\ell}}{\tilde{r}}\right)\leq R\_{\ell}^%
{1+2\delta} and we conclude that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left\|v\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{\ell}))} | \displaystyle\geq\exp\left(-R\_{\ell}^{1+2\delta}\right)\geq\exp\left(-\left|z\_% {\ell}\right|^{1+2\delta}\right). |  |

As \left|z\_{\ell}\right|\geq r\_{\alpha}, an application of Lemma 3 shows that T\_{\alpha}\left(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{\ell})\right)\subset B\_{1}(T\_{\alpha}(z\_{\ell%
})) and then

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left\|u\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{1}(T\_{\alpha}(z\_{\ell})))}\geq% \left\|u\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(T\_{\alpha}\left(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{\ell})\right))}=% \left\|v\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{\ell}))} | \displaystyle\geq\exp\left(-\left|z\_{\ell}\right|^{1+2\delta}\right)=\exp\left% (-r\_{\ell}^{1+2\delta}\right). |  |

Because we assumed that w\_{0} belongs to the positive x-axis and has \left|w\_{0}\right|=r\_{\ell}^{\alpha}, then T\_{\alpha}(z\_{\ell})=\left(r\_{\ell}^{\alpha},0\right)=w\_{0}.
Since \delta=\frac{\varepsilon}{2-N}, then \frac{1+2\delta}{\alpha}=\left(1-\frac{N}{2}\right)\left(1+2\delta\right)=1-%
\frac{N}{2}+\varepsilon and r\_{\ell}^{1+2\delta}=\left|w\_{0}\right|^{1-\frac{N}{2}+\varepsilon}.
Combining these observations shows that \left\|u\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{1}(w\_{0}))}\geq\exp\left(-\left|w\_{0}\right|^{%
1-\frac{N}{2}+\varepsilon}\right).
Since w\_{0}\in\mathbb{R}^{2} with \left|w\_{0}\right|\geq R\_{0} was arbitrary, then (1.7) follows, as required.
