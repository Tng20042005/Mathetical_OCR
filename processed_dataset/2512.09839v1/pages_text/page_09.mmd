Define \Omega=B\_{R}\setminus\left(F\_{0}\bigcup F\_{1}\right) and \Omega\_{1}=B\_{R}\setminus F\_{1}.
As shown in [LMNN20, §3.1], there exists a universal constant c\_{P} (that depends on c\_{s}) so that \Omega has Poincaré constant bounded above by c\_{P}\rho^{2}.
In particular, since c\_{P}\rho^{2}\left\|W\right\|\_{L^{\infty}(B\_{R})}\leq c\_{P}\rho^{2}a^{2}, then by choosing \rho\leq\rho\_{0}, a universal constant, we can apply [LMNN20, Lemma 3.2].
For \varepsilon\ll 1 to be defined later on, let

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.4) |  | \rho=\varepsilon a^{-1}. |  |

An application of the arguments in [LMNN20, §3.2] then shows that there exists \phi:\Omega\to\mathbb{R} with the properties that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Delta\phi-W\phi=0\text{ in }\Omega |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\phi-1\in W^{1,2}\_{0}(\Omega) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5) |  | \displaystyle\left\|\phi-1\right\|\_{\infty}\leq c\_{b}\left(\rho a\right)^{2}=c% \_{b}\varepsilon^{2}, |  |

where c\_{b} is a universal constant that depends on c\_{P}, and we have used (3.4).
By extending \phi to equal 1 across F\_{0}\bigcup F\_{1}, it is then shown in [LMNN20, Lemma 4.1] that \displaystyle f:=\frac{v}{\phi}\in W^{1,2}\_{\operatorname{loc}}(B\_{R}) is a weak solution to the divergence-form equation

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{div}\left(\phi^{2}\nabla f\right)=0\;\text{ in }\Omega\_{1}. |  |

Moreover, the bound in (3.5) implies that for any z\in B\_{R},

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.6) |  | \left(1-c\_{b}\varepsilon^{2}\right)\left|f(z)\right|\leq\left|v(z)\right|\leq% \left(1+c\_{b}\varepsilon^{2}\right)\left|f(z)\right|. |  |

We introduce the Beltrami coefficient \mu, defined as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mu=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}\frac{1-\phi^{2}}{1+\phi^{2}}\frac{f\_{x}+if\_{y}}% {f\_{x}-if\_{y}}&\text{ in }\Omega\_{1}\text{ when }\,\nabla f\neq 0\\ 0&\text{ otherwise}\end{array}\right.. |  |

Since \left|\mu\right|\lesssim\varepsilon^{2}, then as shown in [AIM09], there exists a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism of the complex plane where K\leq 1+C\_{K}\varepsilon^{2} and C\_{K} depends on c\_{b}.
That is, there exists some w\in W^{1,2}\_{\operatorname{loc}} that satisfies the Beltrami equation \displaystyle\frac{\partial w}{\partial\overline{z}}=\mu\frac{\partial w}{%
\partial z}.
In fact, an application of the Riemann uniformization theorem shows that there exists a K-quasiconformal homeomorphism g:B\_{R}\to B\_{R} that is onto with g(0)=0.
Moreover, the function h:=f\circ g^{-1} is harmonic in g(\Omega\_{1}).

Mori’s Theorem implies that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.7) |  | \frac{1}{16}\left|\frac{z\_{1}-z\_{2}}{R}\right|^{K}\leq\frac{\left|g(z\_{1})-g(z% \_{2})\right|}{R}\leq 16\left|\frac{z\_{1}-z\_{2}}{R}\right|^{\frac{1}{K}}. |  |

Thus, if we set

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.8) |  | \varepsilon=\sqrt{\frac{\ln 2}{2C\_{K}\log R}}, |  |

then \displaystyle K\in\left[1,1+\frac{\ln 2}{2\log R}\right] and R\simeq R^{K}\simeq R^{\frac{1}{K}}.
Since the arguments above hold when \rho=\frac{\varepsilon}{a}\leq\rho\_{0}, then we ensure that R\geq R\_{1}:=\exp\left[\frac{\ln 2}{2C\_{K}\left(a\rho\_{0}\right)^{2}}\right].
If \left|z\_{1}-z\_{2}\right|=\rho, (3.7) shows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\left|g(z\_{1})-g(z\_{2})\right|\leq 16R\left(\frac{\rho}{R}\right)% ^{\frac{1}{K}}=16\rho\left(\frac{aR}{\varepsilon}\right)^{1-\frac{1}{K}}. |  |

If R\geq R\_{2}:=\inf\left\{R>0:\frac{R^{2}}{\log R}\geq\frac{2C\_{K}a^{2}}{\ln 2}\right\}, then \frac{a}{\varepsilon}\leq R and
