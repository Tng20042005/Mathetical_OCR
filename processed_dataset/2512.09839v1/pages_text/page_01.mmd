###### Abstract.

We investigate the quantitative unique continuation properties of real-valued solutions to planar Schrödinger equations with potential functions that exhibit pointwise decay at infinity.
That is, for equations of the form -\Delta u+Vu=0 in \mathbb{R}^{2}, where \left|V(z)\right|\lesssim\left<z\right>^{-N} for some N>0, we prove that real-valued solutions satisfy exponential decay estimates with a rate that depends explicitly on N.
Examples show that the estimates established here are essentially sharp.
The case of N=0 corresponds to the Landis conjecture, which was proved for real-valued solutions in the plane in [LMNN20], while the case of N<0 was previously investigated by the author in [Dav24].
Here, the proof techniques rely on the ideas presented in [LMNN20] combined with conformal transformations and an iteration scheme.

## 1. Introduction

This article is concerned with the quantitative unique continuation of solutions to elliptic Schrödinger equations in the plane.
We consider equations with potentials that exhibits pointwise decay at infinity.
The main result is a nearly sharp estimate for the optimal rate of decay at infinity for real-valued solutions.
This theorem may be interpreted as a quantitative Landis-type theorem.

In the late 1960s, E. M. Landis [KL88] conjectured that if u and V are bounded functions that satisfy

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.1) |  | -\Delta u+Vu=0\;\text{ in }\,\mathbb{R}^{n}, |  |

and u decays faster than exponentially, i.e., \left|u(x)\right|\lesssim\exp\left(-c\left|x\right|^{1+}\right), then it follows that u\equiv 0.
This conjecture was later disproved by Meshkov [M92] who constructed non-trivial complex-valued functions u and V that solve (1.1) in \mathbb{R}^{2}, where V is bounded and \left|u(x)\right|\lesssim\exp\left(-c\left|x\right|^{4/3}\right).
Using Carleman estimate techniques, Meshkov also proved a qualitative unique continuation result:
If (1.1) holds, where V is bounded and u satisfies a decay estimate of the form \left|u\left(x\right)\right|\lesssim\exp\left(-c\left|x\right|^{4/3+}\right), then necessarily u\equiv 0.

In their work on Anderson localization [BK05], Bourgain and Kenig established a quantitative version of Meshkov’s result.
As a first step in their proof, they used three-ball inequalities derived from Carleman estimates to establish order of vanishing estimates for local solutions to Schrödinger equations of the form (1.1).
Then, through a scaling argument, they proved a quantitative unique continuation result.
More specifically, they showed that if u and V are bounded and satisfy (1.1), and u is normalized so that \left|u(0)\right|\geq 1, then for sufficiently large values of R,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.2) |  | \inf\_{|x\_{0}|=R}\left\|u\right\|\_{L^{\infty}\left(B\_{1}(x\_{0})\right)}\geq\exp% {(-CR^{\beta}\log R)}, |  |

where \beta=\frac{4}{3}.
Since \frac{4}{3}>1, the constructions of Meshkov, in combination with the qualitative and quantitative unique continuation theorems just described, indicate that Landis’ conjecture cannot be true for complex-valued solutions in \mathbb{R}^{2}.
However, at the time, Landis’ conjecture still remained open in the real-valued and higher-dimensional settings.

The first significant step towards resolving Landis’ conjecture in the real-valued planar setting was made by Kenig, Silvestre and Wang in [KSW15] where they proved a quantitative form of Landis’ conjecture under the assumption that the zeroth-order term satisfies V\geq 0 a.e.
The techniques in [KSW15] exploit the relationship between real-valued solutions to second-order elliptic PDEs in the plane and solutions to complex-valued Beltrami equations.
Using similar ideas, analogous results were established in the settings with drift terms [KW15], variable coefficients [DKW17], singular lower-order terms [DW20], and when V\_{-} exhibits decay at infinity [DKW19, Dav20a].
Then, in [LMNN20], Logunov, Malinnikova, Nadirashvili, and Nazarov proved Landis’ conjecture in the real-valued planar setting.
Their proof uses the nodal structure of the domain along with a domain reduction technique to eliminate any sign condition on the zeroth-order term.
Many of the ideas from [LMNN20] are used in this article.

In [Dav14], we studied the quantitative unique continuation properties of solutions to elliptic equations of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Delta u+W\cdot\nabla u+Vu=\lambda u\;\text{ in }\;\mathbb{R}^{n}, |  |

where V and W exhibit pointwise decay at infinity, and \lambda\in\mathbb{C}.
With \left<x\right>=\sqrt{1+\left|x\right|^{2}}, it was shown that if \left|V\left(x\right)\right|\lesssim\left<x\right>^{-N} and \left|W\left(x\right)\right|\lesssim\left<x\right>^{-P} for N,P\geq 0, then the quantitative estimate (1.2) holds with \beta=\max\left\{1,\frac{4-2N}{3},2-2P\right\} and \log R replaced by a different slowly-decaying function.
These quantitative estimates were generalized in [LW14], where Lin and Wang proved analogous estimates for solutions to the corresponding equations with variable-coefficient leading terms.
Qualitative estimates for similar equations are given in [CS97].
The constructions presented in [Dav14, Dav15] show that the estimates described in this paragraph are sharp.
