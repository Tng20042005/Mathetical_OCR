Considering only the disks D\_{j} for which 3D\_{j}\subset\left\{\frac{r}{2}<\left|z\right|<R-1\right\}, define z\_{j}\in\partial\left(3D\_{j}\right) to be the point that is closest to the origin, i.e. has the smallest modulus.
Then set \displaystyle m\_{j}=\min\_{\partial\left(3D\_{j}\right)}\left|h\right|.
Define j\_{0} to be the index for which

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.11) |  | m\_{j\_{0}}\left|z\_{j\_{0}}\right|^{-k}=\max\_{j}m\_{j}\left|z\_{j}\right|^{-k} |  |

and let j\_{1} be the index for which

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{\Omega}\left|f\right|=\sup\_{\partial\left(3D\_{j\_{1}}\right)}\left|f% \right|. |  |

For any z\in\Omega, an application of Lemma 1 shows that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.12) |  | \left|\nabla h(z)\right|\left|z\right|^{-k}\leq\sup\_{\Omega}\left|f\right|=% \sup\_{\partial\left(3D\_{j\_{1}}\right)}\left|\nabla h(z)\right|\left|z\_{j\_{1}}% \right|^{-k}\leq C\_{H}m\_{j\_{1}}\left|z\_{j\_{1}}\right|^{-k}\leq C\_{H}m\_{j\_{0}}% \left|z\_{j\_{0}}\right|^{-k}, |  |

so we see that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left|\nabla h(z)\right|\leq C\_{H}m\_{j\_{0}}\left(\frac{\left|z\right|}{\left|z% \_{j\_{0}}\right|}\right)^{k}. |  |

Since \displaystyle\sup\_{\Omega}\left|\nabla h\right|\geq\frac{1}{8R} and this estimate holds for every z\in\Omega, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \frac{1}{8R}\leq C\_{H}m\_{j\_{0}}\left(\frac{\left|z\right|}{\left|z\_{j\_{0}}% \right|}\right)^{k}\leq C\_{H}m\_{j\_{0}}\left(\frac{2R}{r}\right)^{k}. |  |

In particular,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.13) |  | \left|h(z\_{j\_{0}})\right|\geq m\_{j\_{0}}\geq\frac{1}{8C\_{H}R}\left(\frac{r}{2R}% \right)^{k}. |  |

Define s=\inf\left\{\tau\leq 1:tz\_{j\_{0}}\in\Omega\text{ for all }t\in\left(\tau,1%
\right)\right\} so that the straight line path given by \gamma(t)=tz\_{j\_{0}} for s<t<1 is contained in \Omega while sz\_{t\_{0}}\in\partial\Omega.
Integrating \nabla h along \gamma shows that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle h(z\_{j\_{0}})-h(sz\_{j\_{0}}) | \displaystyle=\int\_{\gamma}\nabla h\left(z\right)\cdot dz=\int\_{s}^{1}\nabla h% (tz\_{j\_{0}})\cdot z\_{j\_{0}}dt. |  |

Applications of (2.12) and (2.13) show that

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.14) |  | \displaystyle\left|h(sz\_{j\_{0}})\right| | \displaystyle\geq\left|h(z\_{j\_{0}})\right|-\left|\int\_{s}^{1}\nabla h(tz\_{j\_{0% }})\cdot z\_{j\_{0}}dt\right|\geq\left|h(z\_{j\_{0}})\right|-\left|z\_{j\_{0}}\right% |\left|\int\_{s}^{1}C\_{H}m\_{j\_{0}}t^{k}dt\right| |  |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq m\_{j\_{0}}-\frac{m\_{j\_{0}}C\_{H}R}{k+1}=m\_{j\_{0}}\left(1-\frac% {C\_{H}R}{k+1}\right)>\frac{m\_{j\_{0}}}{2}, |  |

where the last inequality uses that k+1>2C\_{H}R.
Since k\geq 2C\_{H}R, then 2^{k}>16C\_{H}R and it follows that
