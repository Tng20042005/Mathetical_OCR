###### Lemma 3 (Ball containment).

Let z\_{0}=(r\_{0},0) and set \displaystyle\tilde{r}=\frac{r\_{0}^{1-\alpha}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}.
There exists r\_{\alpha}>0 so that whenever with r\_{0}\geq r\_{\alpha}, it holds that T\_{\alpha}(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{0}))\subset B\_{1}(T\_{\alpha}(z\_{0})) and B\_{1}(T\_{\alpha}(z\_{0}))\subset T\_{\alpha}\left(B\_{1}(z\_{0})\right).

###### Proof.

With \tilde{r} as given, it can be shown that

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.2) |  | \displaystyle B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{0}) | \displaystyle\subset\left\{r\in[r\_{0}-\tilde{r},r\_{0}+\tilde{r}],\left|\theta% \right|\leq\frac{2\tilde{r}}{\sqrt{3}r\_{0}}\right\} |  |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\left\{r\in\left[r\_{0}\left(1-\frac{r\_{0}^{-\alpha}}{2\sqrt{3}% \alpha}\right),r\_{0}\left(1+\frac{r\_{0}^{-\alpha}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}\right)% \right],\left|\theta\right|\leq\frac{1}{3\alpha r\_{0}^{\alpha}}\right\}. |  |

With w\_{0}=T\_{\alpha}(z\_{0})=\left(r\_{0}^{\alpha},0\right)=\left(\rho\_{0},0\right), it follows from (4.2) that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle T\_{\alpha}(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{0})) | \displaystyle\subset\left\{r^{\alpha}\in\left[r\_{0}^{\alpha}\left(1-\frac{r\_{0% }^{-\alpha}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}\right)^{\alpha},r\_{0}^{\alpha}\left(1+\frac{r\_{0% }^{-\alpha}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}\right)^{\alpha}\right],\left|\alpha\theta\right|% \leq\frac{\alpha}{3\alpha r\_{0}^{\alpha}}\right\} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\left\{\rho\in\left[\rho\_{0}\left(1-\frac{\rho\_{0}^{-1}}{2\sqrt{% 3}\alpha}\right)^{\alpha},\rho\_{0}\left(1+\frac{\rho\_{0}^{-1}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha% }\right)^{\alpha}\right],\left|\varphi\right|\leq\frac{1}{3\rho\_{0}}\right\}. |  |

Since

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\rho\_{0}\left(1\pm\frac{\rho\_{0}^{-1}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}\right)^{\alpha} | \displaystyle=\rho\_{0}\pm\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}+\frac{(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})}{24}r\_% {0}^{-\alpha}+\ldots |  |

then there exists r\_{1}(\alpha)\gg 1 so that whenever r\_{0}\geq r\_{1}, we have \rho\_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\leq\rho\_{0}\left(1-\frac{\rho\_{0}^{-1}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}%
\right)^{\alpha} and \rho\_{0}\left(1+\frac{\rho\_{0}^{-1}}{2\sqrt{3}\alpha}\right)^{\alpha}\leq\rho\_%
{0}+\frac{1}{2}.
Because,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.3) |  | \displaystyle B\_{1}(w\_{0})\supset\left\{\rho\in\left[\rho\_{0}-\frac{1}{2},\rho% \_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\right],\left|\varphi\right|\leq\frac{1}{3\rho\_{0}}\right\}, |  |

then it follows that T\_{\alpha}(B\_{\tilde{r}}(z\_{0}))\subset B\_{1}(w\_{0}).

On the other hand, with T\_{\alpha}^{-1}(B\_{1}(w\_{0}))=\left\{z:T\_{\alpha}(z)\in B\_{1}(w\_{0})\right\}, (4.2) (with \tilde{r} replaced by 1) implies that
