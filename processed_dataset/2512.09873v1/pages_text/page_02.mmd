Our primary objective is to seek the sufficient and necessary geometric conditions on G such that the unique continuation and observability hold.

### 1.1. History and setting

From the early work of Russell [Rus71], the studies of the controllability and observability for wave equations have been central topics in control theory.

#### 1.1.1. Geometric control condition

In the pioneering work of Rauch and Taylor [RT74], they first related the observability to a geometric condition on the damped region \omega and the rays of geometric optics in the boundaryless case.
Later, in another pioneering work of Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch [BLR92], the well-known Geometric control condition is introduced: for an open observed region \omega, every generalized ray should meet \omega in a finite time.

Since then, it has become one of the most natural assumptions for the controlled waves. In the existing literature, the observation is most often made on cylindrical domains G=(0,T)\times\omega, with \omega being an open subset. Under suitable smooth conditions, it is well-known that GCC is sufficient, and depending on the domain, necessary for the observability in the cylindrical domains (0,T)\times\omega, see [BLR92, BG97]. When considering stabilization problems, GCC is also a useful condition for the exponential decay of energy. We refer to [RT74, Har89]. Otherwise, one may have logarithmic type of energy decay results [LR97, Bur98]. GCC also plays a role in practical issues, such as sensor designs, tomography techniques used for imaging bodies (see [LRLTT17] for example), etc. For a comprehensive reference of the numerical study, we refer to [Zua05] and its references therein.

Finally, we give a very brief overview of the boundary control case. There are also fruitful results in this direction. For related GCC, we refer to [Leb92]. In particular, for 1D wave equations, one can find many nonlinear results [Li10, LY06] and the references therein.

#### 1.1.2. Unique continuation

A qualitative version of observability is the unique continuation property.
The easiest way to ensure this property is to apply the analyticity based on Holmgren’s theorem. Besides, Hörmander’s pseudo-convexity condition and Carleman estimates are powerful tools dealing with the unique continuation problem. In this direction, there is a large literature such as [RZ98, Tat95, Hör92, Hör97] and more recent work includes [LL19, MS21, FLL25, Sha19]. Here we point out that to construct the appropriate weight to apply Carleman estimates, it is crucial to understand the behavior across the suitable spacetime surfaces, which is more delicate than considering a cylindrical region.

#### 1.1.3. Our setting: spacetime measurable observable region

Recently, researchers started to focus on
the spacetime setting [CCM14, LRLTT17, Sha19, Kle25]. Meanwhile, the study of the case where G is a spacetime region is far from complete, even for open regions.

In this paper, we focus on the setting that G\subset[0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}} is measurable of positive measure. The following condition may be viewed as the natural analogue of the standard geometric control condition in this spacetime measurable setting.

1. (GCC)

   Let T>0. A measurable set G\subset[0,T]\times\mathbb{T} is said to satisfy
   the GCC if there exists a constant
   c\_{0}>0 such that for almost every x\in\mathbb{T},

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \int\_{0}^{T}\mathbf{1}\_{G}(s,x\pm s){\,\rm d}s\geq c\_{0}. |  | (1.4) |

From now on, in this paper, (GCC) refers to the preceding definition with respect to (1.4).
It is well-known that under the standard setting, namely the observable region is a cylinder [0,T]\times\omega, GCC yields several important properties: weak observability and the necessity of observability. These results can be generalized to the spacetime (GCC) for a spacetime measurable observable region. We put the former result in Section 4.1 and the later in Appendix A.3.

### 1.2. A new symmetry condition

Extend the system 2\pi-periodically to x\in\mathbb{R}, and introduce the null coordinate:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \xi=x+t\;\textrm{ and }\;\eta=x-t. |  |

Under this new coordinate,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2u\_{\xi}=u\_{x}+u\_{t}\;\textrm{ and }\;2u\_{\eta}=u\_{x}-u\_{t} |  |

and the wave equation (1.3) becomes222We considered the equation on U(\xi,\eta):=u(t,x) and F(\xi,\eta)=f(t,x). For ease of notation, we still denote U by u and F by f.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 4\partial\_{\xi}\partial\_{\eta}u=f\mathbf{1}\_{G}. |  |

For any \xi\_{0}\in\mathbb{R}, we denote the line \{(t,x):x+t=\xi\_{0}\} by L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}}, and call it the \xi-characteristic. Similarly, we denote the line \{(t,x):x-t=\eta\_{0}\} by L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}} and call it L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}} the \eta-characteristic. Thus the (GCC) is equivalent to

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \textrm{ for }a.e.\;x\in{\mathbb{T}},\mbox{meas}\_{\mathbb{R}}(G\cap L\_{\eta=x}% )\geq c\_{0},\;\;\mbox{meas}\_{\mathbb{R}}(G\cap L\_{\xi=x})\geq c\_{0}. |  | (1.5) |

We further define measurable cylinders for any measurable sets A,B\subset[0,2\pi] as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | L\_{\xi\in A}:=\bigcup\_{\xi\_{0}\in A}L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}}\;\textrm{ and }\;L\_{\eta% \in B}:=\bigcup\_{\eta\_{0}\in B}L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}. |  | (1.6) |

Introduce the following symmetry condition:
