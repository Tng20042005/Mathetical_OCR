###### Definition 2.9 (Weak symmetric function pair).

We say
(f,g) is a weak symmetric function pair if there exists a weak decomposition pair \{(A\_{k},B\_{k}),k\in I\}, a sequence of different numbers \{s\_{k}\}\_{k\in I} such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f=\sum\_{k\in I}s\_{k}\chi\_{A\_{k}},\quad g=\sum\_{k\in I}s\_{k}\chi\_{B\_{k}}\quad% \mbox{ in }L^{2}({\mathbb{T}}) |  |

and

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{{\mathbb{T}}}(f+g)(x){\,\rm d}x=0. |  |

The set of all weak symmetric function pairs is denoted by \mathcal{S}^{2}.

## 3. Sharp unique continuation condition

In this section, we aim to establish a sufficient and necessary condition to ensure the unique continuation property. We begin with the necessity in Section 3.1, where we show that the (weak GCC) is required for unique continuation. The sufficiency is then proved in two steps. On the one hand, we obtain unique continuation under ({\rm OSC}) and (GCC) in Section 3.2. On the other hand, in Section 3.3 we generalize this result and prove unique continuation under ({\rm OSC}) and (weak GCC).

Although the latter already suffices to build the sufficient part, the former offers a cleaner setting in which to present the main ideas in a simpler way, and it will also be used later to complete the proof of wave observability in the next section. For these reasons, we separate the argument into two subsections.

### 3.1. Unique continuation implies weak GCC

We demonstrate that the (weak GCC) introduced here is the minimal geometric requirement for establishing unique continuation.

The free wave equation (1.1), under the null coordinate, becomes \partial\_{\xi}\partial\_{\eta}u=0. Recall the definitions of L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}},L\_{\xi\in A},L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}, and L\_{\eta\in B}. Throughout this section, since the value of T>0 is fixed, we simplify notation by writing

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}}\cap\{[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}\},\;L\_{\xi\in A}\cap% \{[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}\},\;L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}\cap\{[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}\},\;L% \_{\eta\in B}\cap\{[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}\}, |  |

simply as L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}},L\_{\xi\in A},L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}, and L\_{\eta\in B}.

If u is a smooth solution to (1.1), then the classical theory of transport equation shows that \partial\_{\xi}u is invariant along the \xi-characteristics and \partial\_{\eta}u is invariant along the \eta-characteristics. In our setting with \partial\_{\xi}u,\partial\_{\eta}u\in L^{2}({\mathbb{T}}), one has \partial\_{\xi}u,\partial\_{\eta}u are constant almost everywhere on characteristic lines; its proof is left in Section A.2.
