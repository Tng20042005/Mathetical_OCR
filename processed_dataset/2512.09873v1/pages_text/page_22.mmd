As a consequence, we obtain the weak observability up to a compact term:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|u\_{0}\|^{2}\_{\dot{H}^{1}({\mathbb{T}})}+\|u\_{1}\|^{2}\_{L^{2}({\mathbb{T}})}% \leq(4\pi C+1)N^{2}\left(\int\_{G}|\partial\_{t}u(t,x)|^{2}{\,\rm d}x{\,\rm d}t+% \|u\_{0,N}\|^{2}\_{L^{2}({\mathbb{T}})}+\|u\_{1,N}\|^{2}\_{\dot{H}^{-1}({\mathbb{T% }})}\right). |  |

∎

### 4.2. Sufficient part of Theorem 1.5

Now we prove that ({\rm OSC}) and (GCC) are sufficient to establish the observability inequality (1.2). We argue by contradiction.

Assume that (1.2) fails. Then there exists a sequence of initial data
(u\_{0,n},u\_{1,n})\in\dot{H}^{1}(\mathbb{T})\times L^{2}(\mathbb{T}) for n=1,2,\dots, such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|\partial\_{x}u\_{0,n}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}+\|u\_{1,n}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}=1, |  |

and

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{G}|\partial\_{t}u\_{n}(t,x)|^{2}{\,\rm d}x{\,\rm d}t\to 0\quad\text{as }n% \to\infty, |  | (4.4) |

where u\_{n} is the solution of (1.1) with initial data (u\_{0,n},u\_{1,n}). Therefore, we may extract a subsequence, still denoted by (u\_{0,n},u\_{1,n}), that converges weakly in \dot{H}^{1}(\mathbb{T})\times L^{2}(\mathbb{T}) to some (u\_{0},u\_{1}). Correspondingly, (u\_{n},\partial\_{t}u\_{n}) converges weakly in \dot{H}^{1}(\mathbb{T})\times L^{2}(\mathbb{T}) to a solution (u,\partial\_{t}u) of (1.1).

On one hand, from (4.4) we obtain for the limit

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{G}|\partial\_{t}u|^{2}{\,\rm d}x{\,\rm d}t=0, |  |

which implies \partial\_{t}u=0 almost everywhere in G. Then, the unique continuation property, Corollary 3.5 yields u\equiv 0.

On the other hand, since u\_{n} solves (1.1), Corollary 4.2 gives the weak observability estimate

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1=\|\partial\_{x}u\_{0,n}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}+\|u\_{1,n}\|\_{L^{2}}^{2}\leq C\Bigl{(}% \int\_{G}|\partial\_{t}u\_{n}(t,x)|^{2}{\,\rm d}x{\,\rm d}t+\|u\_{0,n}\|\_{L^{2}(% \mathbb{T})}^{2}+\|u\_{1,n}\|\_{\dot{H}^{-1}(\mathbb{T})}^{2}\Bigr{)}. |  | (4.5) |

Because the embedding \dot{H}^{1}\times L^{2}\hookrightarrow L^{2}\times\dot{H}^{-1} is compact, the convergence (u\_{0,n},u\_{1,n})\to(u\_{0},u\_{1}) holds strongly in L^{2}(\mathbb{T})\times\dot{H}^{-1}(\mathbb{T}). Passing to the limit n\to\infty in (4.5) yields

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1\leq C\bigl{(}\|u\_{0}\|\_{L^{2}(\mathbb{T})}^{2}+\|u\_{1}\|\_{\dot{H}^{-1}(% \mathbb{T})}^{2}\bigr{)}, |  |

which contradicts the fact that u\equiv 0 (and hence u\_{0}=0, u\_{1}=0 in the relevant spaces). Consequently, the observability inequality (1.2) must hold.

## 5. Other important geometric configurations

In this work, we have provided a necessary and sufficient condition on a spacetime measurable observable region for the wave equation. In the literature, many other important geometric configurations are considered, such as measurable Cartesian products E\_{t}\times F\_{x}, general spacetime open sets, and especially [0,T]\times\omega with open set \omega. In this section, we comment on our condition in these cases.

### 5.1. Cylinder observable region [0,T]\times\omega

This is the most classical setting. Let us now restrict the geometric region G to the following class: for a given T>0, consider

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | G\in\mathcal{D}\_{1}(T):=\{[0,T]\times\omega:\omega\in{\mathbb{T}}\textrm{ open% }\}. |  |

Our criterion clearly provides a sufficient condition for the observability on such regions. However, the observable symmetry condition automatically fails for “many” non-trivial pairs (A,B)\in[0,2\pi]. This is evident from the geometry illustrated in Fig. 7. Therefore, there is no need to consider ({\rm OSC}) in this setting.

### 5.2. Measurable Cartesian products E\_{t}\times F\_{x}

Next, we restrict G to the following class: for a given T>0, consider (see Fig. 8)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | G\in\mathcal{D}\_{2}(T):=\{E\_{t}\times F\_{x}:E\_{t}\in{\mathbb{T}},F\_{x}\in{% \mathbb{T}}\textrm{ are measurable sets}\}. |  |
