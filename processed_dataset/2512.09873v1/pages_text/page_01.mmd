###### Abstract.

In this work, we discover a new symmetry structure for the 1D wave equations associated with spacetime observable regions: observable symmetry condition. This structure yields a new conservation law for forced wave equations and provides a necessary condition for unique continuation, observability, and controllability.

Building on this symmetry, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for unique continuation by introducing a weak GCC. Moreover, this symmetry serves as an essential complement to the classical GCC, allowing us to derive a necessary and sufficient characterization of observability and controllability through spacetime geometric regions.

## 1. Introduction

Let T>0. Let G\subset[0,T]\times\mathbb{T} be a spacetime measurable set with positive measure.
Consider the observability problem of the wave equation: whether there exists some C=C(G)>0 such that every solution u to

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (\partial\_{t}^{2}-\partial\_{x}^{2})u=0,\quad(u,\partial\_{t}u)\big{|}\_{t=0}=(u\_% {0},u\_{1})\in\dot{H}^{1}({\mathbb{T}})\times L^{2}({\mathbb{T}}), |  | (1.1) |

satisfies

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|u\_{0}\|^{2}\_{\dot{H}^{1}({\mathbb{T}})}+\|u\_{1}\|^{2}\_{L^{2}({\mathbb{T}})}% \leq C\int\_{G}|\partial\_{t}u(t,x)|^{2}{\,\rm d}t{\,\rm d}x. |  | (1.2) |

Thanks to the classical Hilbert uniqueness method and an argument to raise regularity (see Appendix A.1 for details on this reduction), the observability of (1.2) is equivalent to the exact controllability of
the controlled wave equation on [0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}} with control force f\in L^{2}(G):
