The counterexample.
Let T=2\pi. Let G\subset[0,2\pi]\times{\mathbb{T}} be given in Fig. 2. Clearly G satisfies (GCC). However, the observable symmetry condition holds for A=B=(0,\pi) or A=B=(\pi,2\pi). Then one can show that the observability inequality (1.2) fails on G, see Section 2.2.

### 1.3. Necessary and sufficient unique continuation conditon

The second result is about the unique continuation property (UCP). Let T>0 and let G\in[0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}} be a measurable set. UCP is the qualitative version of the observability and asks:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mbox{(UCP) \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; Let $u$ be a solution of \eqref{eq: % wave-eq-0} and }u\_{t}=0\mbox{ a.e. in }G\Longrightarrow u\equiv 0.\;\;\;\;\;\;% \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; |  |

Motivated by the geometric features of the system, we formulate the following minimal geometric assumption on the observation region, which is required for unique continuation.

1. (Weak GCC)

   Let T>0. A measurable set G\subset[0,T]\times\mathbb{T} is said to satisfy the
   weak GCC if for almost every
   x\in\mathbb{T},

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \int\_{0}^{T}\mathbf{1}\_{G}(s,x\pm s){\,\rm d}s>0. |  |

This condition is equivalent to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \textrm{ for }a.e.\;x\in{\mathbb{T}},\mbox{meas}\_{\mathbb{R}}(G\cap L\_{\eta=x}% )>0,\;\;\mbox{meas}\_{\mathbb{R}}(G\cap L\_{\xi=x})>0. |  |

Compared to the standard (GCC), it is not required a uniform positive lower bound.

###### Theorem 1.3.

Let T>0 and G\subset[0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}} be a spacetime measurable set. The following statements are equivalent.

* (1)

  UCP holds on G.
* (2)

  G satisfies (weak GCC) and does not obey ({\rm OSC}) for any non-trivial pair (A,B)666Reminder: for simplicity, when there is no risk of confusion, sometimes we simply write (OSC) indicating that the set G does not obey the observable symmetry condition for any non-trivial pair (A,B)..
