###### Remark 1.4.

The essence of this result lies in the role of the observable symmetry condition. Under the minimal (weak GCC) assumption, unique continuation can be established only up to a symmetric function pair belonging to the class \mathcal{S}^{2}, which is generated precisely by the observable symmetry condition (see Definitions 2.9). In other words, the (weak GCC) eliminates all obstructions except those arising from the intrinsic symmetry group, and full uniqueness is recovered once solutions are taken modulo this symmetry.

### 1.4. Necessary and sufficient observability/controllability condition

Finally, we obtain the following sharp and complete geometric characterization of observable regions.

###### Theorem 1.5.

Let T>0 and let G\subset[0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}} be a measurable set. Then the following two statements are equivalent.

* (1)

  The observability inequality (1.2) holds on G;
* (2)

  G satisfies (GCC) and does not obey ({\rm OSC}) for any non-tirvial pair (A,B).

To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first necessary and sufficient geometric condition for observability of the wave equation on spacetime region. The observable symmetry condition plays a central role: it completes the classical GCC by capturing the additional geometric structure. This viewpoint also leads to necessary and sufficient conditions in a variety of other important geometric configurations, such as [0,T]\times\omega, measurable Cartesian products E\_{t}\times F\_{x}, and general spacetime open sets. A detailed comparison is presented in Section 5.

###### Remark 1.6.

The main theorem reveals two structural features of observability that distinguish the wave equation from other important models, for example, the heat equation, [AEWZ14, WWZZ19]. First, the family of observable regions \mathcal{O}(T) depends intrinsically on T; non-observable sets arise from geometric obstructions that vary with T, leading to a genuinely time-dependent structure for \{\mathcal{O}(T)\}\_{T>0}.
Second, our characterization also suggests that no waiting time is needed for observability, indicating that, for wave equations, the spacetime geometry of the observation region may play a more decisive role than the duration of control. See Section 6.

Moreover, we believe that the symmetry mechanism uncovered in this work may extend to other instances of wave equations and to a broader range of models, including coupled systems, semilinear equations, and geometric wave equations. These ideas may also provide insight for higher-dimensional problems, where geometric propagation and microlocal structures are considerably more intricate. In addition, the geometric perspectives here may prove useful in questions of sensor placement, optimization of observation regions, and numerical implementations of control and observability.
