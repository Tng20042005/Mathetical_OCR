In this sense, our work offers a possible viewpoint on the interplay between geometry and control time, suggesting that the geometric configuration of the observation set may, in some cases, play a more fundamental role than the duration of the control.

(3) Coupled transport equations and degenerate control interpretation. The observable symmetry condition may be reformulated in terms of two coupled transport equations supplemented by a degenerate control. This perspective suggests natural extensions to broader classes of PDEs, including coupled wave systems (see [LN26]), where similar hidden symmetries may play a decisive role.

(4) Stability of spacetime damped waves.
Due to the standard energy estimate. The criterion developed in this paper leads directly to stability results for the damped wave equation with spacetime damping regions, providing a unified geometric viewpoint for both damping and observation mechanisms. For related works, one can find [DLZ03, Sun23, LR97, Bur98].

(5) Some practical considerations. The geometric viewpoint developed in this work may also have implications for some practical problems, such as sensor placement [PTZ13], optimization of observation regions [Tré18], and numerical strategies for control and observability [BDE25, EZ13]. In such contexts, identifying the minimal geometric requirements is often essential, and the symmetry-based perspective introduced here may serve as a useful guiding principle.

(6) Other cases. We expect that the same symmetric mechanism extends to wave equations on intervals, half-lines, or the entire real line (see, for instance, [LY06, Li10]). In particular, unique continuation and observability on such domains may also be governed by analogous symmetry structures together with (weak) GCC.

Recently, there are more related works investigating the observability from the spacetime measurable sets in different dispersive models. We refer to [BZ25a, BZ25b, NWX25a, NWX25b]. However, since the principal symbol exhibits different features, the wave equation is distinguished from other typical models.

(7) Higher-dimensional waves.
The symmetry structure uncovered in the 1D torus case may offer insight into how geometric features influence wave propagation at the spacetime level.
At the same time, we wish to emphasize that extending these ideas to higher dimensions remains substantially more challenging. The geometric and microlocal structures involved become significantly richer, and it is not yet clear how the symmetry mechanisms identified here might generalize. Nevertheless, we hope that the viewpoint developed in this work may serve as a useful starting point for further explorations of observability and unique continuation in higher-dimensional settings. We also notice that there is recent progress in Schrödinger setting in [BZ25a].

(8) Semilinear equations and geometric wave models.
An interesting direction is to investigate whether the mechanisms identified here can be extended to semilinear or geometric wave equations. Recently, the controlled flow of geometric maps has been initiated by the last author and his co-authors in [KX24, CX25, CKX25a, CKX25b], highlighting the interplay among PDE, geometry, and control. In geometric wave settings, nonlinear effects may interact with wave propagation in subtle ways, and it remains unclear how the symmetry structure introduced here should be adapted. A better understanding of how spacetime symmetries interact with nonlinear or geometric features may open further possibilities.

### A.1. HUM: Observability and controllability

In this part, we will present two observability inequalities in different functional spaces and their associated controllability result based on the classic Hilbert uniqueness method (HUM). This is a preparation to introduce our sharp geometric conditions.

Let us consider the following adjoint equation:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (\partial\_{t}^{2}-\partial\_{x}^{2})v=0,\;\;(v,\partial\_{t}v)|\_{t=0}=(v\_{0},v\_{% 1})\in L^{2}({\mathbb{T}})\times\dot{H}^{-1}({\mathbb{T}}). |  | (A.1) |

By the standard approach of HUM, the next lemma states the equivalence of controllability and its associated observability in the appropriate Sobolev spaces. We omit its proof and refer to [Cor07, Sec. 2.4].

###### Lemma A.1.

Let f\in L^{2}(G) and u be the solution

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | (\partial\_{t}^{2}-\partial\_{x}^{2})u=f\mathbf{1}\_{G}. |  | (A.2) |

Then, u is exactly controllable in \dot{H}^{1}({\mathbb{T}})\times L^{2}({\mathbb{T}}) if and only if

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|v\_{0}\|^{2}\_{L^{2}({\mathbb{T}})}+\|v\_{1}\|^{2}\_{\dot{H}^{-1}({\mathbb{T}})}% \leq C\int\_{G}|v(t,x)|^{2}{\,\rm d}t{\,\rm d}x |  | (A.3) |

holds for all solutions v for (A.1).

In fact, we prove the equivalence of the two observability (1.2) and (A.3) in Lemma A.2, which is inspired by [LRLTT17, Sec. 2B]. While they proved the equivalence for an open observation domain, for the case of measurable observed sets, the proof follows almost line by line.

###### Lemma A.2.

The observability (1.2) is equivalent to having the same constant C>0 such that
(A.3) holds for every solution v for (A.1). Equivalently, the solution u to (A.2) is exactly controllable in \dot{H}^{1}({\mathbb{T}})\times L^{2}({\mathbb{T}}) if and only if (1.2) holds for all solutions u for (1.1).

### A.2. Some results on transport equations

We first show that, if u solves \partial\_{\xi}\partial\_{\eta}u=0, then \partial\_{\xi}u,\partial\_{\eta}u are constant almost everywhere on characteristic lines.
We start with a lemma.

###### Lemma A.3.

Let f\in L^{2}({\mathbb{T}}). Then the unique solution u\in C(\mathbb{R},L^{2}({\mathbb{T}})) of
