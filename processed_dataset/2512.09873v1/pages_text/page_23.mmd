Although such regions appear much more flexible, still the observable symmetry condition cannot be recovered on many non-trivial measurable product sets, since the time and space components decouple in a way that destroys the underlying symmetry mechanism revealed by our main result.

###### Lemma 5.1.

Let T>0. Let G\in\mathcal{D}\_{2}(T). If G\in\mathcal{D}\_{2}(T) satisfies ({\rm GCC}), then it does not obey ({\rm OSC}) for any non-trivial pair (A,B) in [0,2\pi].

###### Proof.

From the (GCC) assumption, one easily deduces that |E\_{t}|+|F\_{x}|\geq 2\pi. Next, one shows that if for a non-trivial pair (A,B) in [0,2\pi], the set G satisfies the ({\rm OSC}) for (A,B), then G\subset L\_{\xi\in A}\cap L\_{\eta\in B}. By the non-triviality of (A,B), at least one of the two sets has measure smaller than 2\pi. This contradicts the (GCC) assumption.
∎

Consequently, as an application of Theorem 1.5, one has

###### Corollary 5.2.

Let T>0. Let G\in\mathcal{D}\_{2}(T). Then the wave equation is observable on G if and only if ({\rm GCC}) is satisfied.

###### Remark 5.3.

This example suggests a viewpoint for wave equations: in some sense, the optimal shape of the observation region should be considered in spacetime rather than as a Cartesian product. On the one hand, the natural GCC manifests its intrinsic geometric nature in the spacetime setting. On the other hand, the symmetry structure underlying our characterization becomes absent in Cartesian product regions.

### 5.3. General spacetime open regions

One may also consider general spacetime open observation regions. For a given T>0, consider

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{D}\_{3}(T):=\{G\in[0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}}:\textrm{ open}\}. |  |

In this setting, the tools of microlocal analysis are particularly powerful.

On the one hand, our criterion again provides a sufficient condition for observability on any such region. On the other hand, it is also a necessary condition. Indeed, the same counterexample presented in Figure 2 demonstrates that the observable symmetry condition cannot be omitted: even for open spacetime sets, a failure of symmetry leads to a loss of observability.

Motivated by this observation, we obtain an additional sufficient condition for observability in the class \mathcal{D}\_{3}(T).

###### Corollary 5.4.

Let T>0. Let G\in\mathcal{D}\_{3}(T). Then the wave equation is observable on G if \exists c\_{0}>0 such that for “every” x\in{\mathbb{T}}

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{0}^{T}\mathbf{1}\_{G}(s,x\pm s){\,\rm d}s\geq c\_{0}. |  | (5.1) |

###### Proof.

It suffices to demonstrate the symmetry condition. Assume that there is a non-trivial pair (A,B) in [0,2\pi] satisfying the ({\rm OSC}). Since the region G is open, by continuity, we can further assume that A and B are open intervals. Assume that A={\mathbb{T}} or (0,2\pi), while |B|<2\pi, then by the (GCC) assumption and by considering a characteristic starting from {\mathbb{T}}\setminus B, this is not possible. Assume that 0<|A|,|B|<2\pi, and assume that A=(a\_{1},a\_{2}). By the geometry and the fact that G satisfies the ({\rm OSC}) for (A,B), we deduce that the line L\_{\xi=a\_{1}} intersects with G has zero measure. This is in contradiction to the assumption.
∎

###### Remark 5.5.

This example shows that the uniform lower bound of “almost every” geodesic intersects G is essential in the assumption of ({\rm GCC}), even when G is an arbitrary spacetime open region.

## 6. Further comments and perspectives

In this final section, we discuss several additional comments arising from our results and outline a number of directions for future research.

(1) Structure of the observable sets \mathcal{O}(T). Our results provide a complete characterization of observable regions \mathcal{O}(T)\subset[0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}} for every T>0. In sharp contrast with the case of the heat equation, see for instance [AEWZ14, WWZZ19] and the references therein, the family \mathcal{O}(T) for the wave equation exhibits a genuine dependence on T, as is clearly reflected in the construction of non-observable regions.

It would be very interesting to investigate possible structural properties of \{\mathcal{O}(T):T\in(0,+\infty)\}, including inclusion relations, invariance properties, and potential dynamical features.

(2) Absence of waiting time. This characterization shows that, for the wave equation under spacetime setting, no waiting time is required to achieve observability or controllability. In classical studies on cylindrical regions [0,T]\times\omega, it is typical to impose a minimal control time linked to geometric propagation considerations [BLR92, BZ04, BDE20, DZZ08]. Our results suggest a complementary perspective: the geometric structure of the observation region itself may play a more decisive role than the control duration. In particular, once the spacetime region satisfies the symmetry condition identified here, observability holds for every T>0. Conversely, when this geometric requirement is not met, increasing the control time does not by itself restore observability.
