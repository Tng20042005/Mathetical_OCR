Let (\xi\_{0},\eta\_{0}) be a point such that (3.3) holds, namely \partial\_{\xi}u(\xi\_{0},\eta\_{0})=\partial\_{\eta}u(\xi\_{0},\eta\_{0}). Thanks to the equation \partial\_{\xi}\partial\_{\eta}u=0, using Lemma 3.1 one has

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\partial\_{\eta}u|\_{L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}}=\partial\_{\eta}u(\xi\_{0},% \eta\_{0}),\;\;\partial\_{\xi}u|\_{L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}}}=\partial\_{\xi}u(\xi\_{0},\eta\_% {0}) |  |

hold almost everywhere on the lines L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}} and L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}}, respectively.
It follows that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial\_{\eta}u|\_{L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}}=\partial\_{\xi}u|\_{L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}}} |  | (3.4) |

up to sets with zero measure.

On the other hand, if we define \mathcal{U}\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}:=\{\xi;(\xi,\eta\_{0})\in G\}, and
on the \eta-characteristic line L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}} we define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | G\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}:=\{(\xi,\eta)\in G;\eta=\eta\_{0}\}=G\cap L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}. |  |

Then, from the (GCC) with lower bound c\_{0} we know that \sqrt{2}|\mathcal{U}\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}|=|G\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}|\geq c\_{0}.

Hence, by the observation (3.4) one has

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial\_{\eta}u|\_{L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}}=\partial\_{\xi}u|\_{L\_{\xi=\xi\_{0}}}% \textrm{ for almost every }\xi\_{0}\in\mathcal{U}\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}} |  |

up to sets with zero measure.
In particular, we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial\_{\eta}u|\_{\{t=0\}\cap L\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}}=\partial\_{\eta}u(\xi\_{0},% \eta\_{0})=\partial\_{\xi}u|\_{\{t=0\}\cap L\_{\xi\in\mathcal{U}\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}}} |  | (3.5) |

up to sets with zero measure.
Namely, the value of \partial\_{\eta}u(\xi\_{0},\eta\_{0}) determines almost every value of \partial\_{\xi}u|\_{\{t=0\}\cap L\_{\xi\in\mathcal{U}\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}}} for |\mathcal{U}\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}|\geq c\_{0}/\sqrt{2}. This means that \partial\_{\xi}u|\_{\{t=0\}\cap L\_{\xi\in\mathcal{U}\_{\eta=\eta\_{0}}}} is a constant almost everywhere.
Repeating this process if necessary, there exists an integer N\in\mathbb{N}^{\*}, smaller than 1+\sqrt{2}(2\pi+T)/c\_{0}, and finite distinct numbers \{a\_{j}\}\_{1\leq j\leq N} and finite disjoint measurable sets \{\mathcal{U}\_{j}\}\_{1\leq j\leq N}\subset{\mathbb{T}} such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial\_{\xi}u|\_{t=0}=\sum\_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{1}\_{\mathcal{U}\_{j}}(x)a\_{j},% \quad a.e.x\in{\mathbb{T}} |  | (3.6) |

with \bigcup\_{j}\mathcal{U}\_{j}={\mathbb{T}},|\mathcal{U}\_{j}|\geq c\_{0}/\sqrt{2}. Similarly, there exists an integer M, smaller than 1+\sqrt{2}(2\pi+T)/c\_{0} and distinct constants \{b\_{k}\}\_{1\leq k\leq M} and
disjoint measurable sets \{\mathcal{V}\_{k}\}\_{1\leq k\leq M} such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial\_{\eta}u|\_{t=0}=\sum\_{k=1}^{M}\mathbf{1}\_{\mathcal{V}\_{k}}(x)b\_{k},% \quad a.e.x\in{\mathbb{T}} |  | (3.7) |

with \bigcup\_{k}\mathcal{V}\_{k}={\mathbb{T}},|\mathcal{V}\_{k}|\geq c\_{0}/\sqrt{2}.

Note that, for almost every point (\xi\_{0},\eta\_{0})\in G, we know that \xi\_{0}\in\bigcup\_{j=1}^{N}\mathcal{U}\_{j} and \eta\_{0}\in\bigcup\_{k=1}^{M}\mathcal{V}\_{k}. Let us assume that (\xi\_{0},\eta\_{0})\in\mathcal{U}\_{j}\times\mathcal{V}\_{k}=L\_{\xi\in\mathcal{U}%
\_{j}}\cap L\_{\eta\in\mathcal{V}\_{k}}. Similar to the previous discussion, we obtain
