### 2.3. Necessary for unique continuation

Proposition 2.2 is equivalent to the necessity of observability by duality.

###### Proposition 2.4 (Observability implies OSC).

If the observability (1.2) holds on some observation set G\subset[0,T]\times{\mathbb{T}}, then for all non-trivial pair (A,B), G does not obey the ({\rm OSC}) for (A,B).

Indeed, we can even show that OSC is necessary for the unique continuation property.

###### Proposition 2.5 (UCP implies OSC).

Assume that the following unique continuation property holds

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mbox{ Let u be a solution of \eqref{eq: wave-eq-0} and }u\_{t}=0\mbox{ a.e. in% }G\Longrightarrow u\equiv 0. |  |

Then for any non-trivial pair (A,B), G does not obey the ({\rm OSC}) for (A,B).

###### Proof.

We argue by contradiction. Assume that
there are two non-trivial sets A,B such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mbox{meas}\_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\Big{(}[G\cap L\_{\xi\in A}]\,\Delta\,[G\cap L\_{% \eta\in B}]\Big{)}=0. |  |

This implies that (see Fig. 6)

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle G\subset(L\_{\xi\in A}\cap L\_{\eta\in B})\cup\Big{(}([0,T]\times{% \mathbb{T}})\backslash(L\_{\xi\in A}\cup L\_{\eta\in B})\Big{)}. |  | (2.7) |
