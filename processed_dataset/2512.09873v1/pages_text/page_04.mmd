Let A,B\subset{\mathbb{T}}. Assume that G satisfies the (A,B)-observable symmetry condition.
Let (u,u\_{t})\in C([0,T];\dot{H}^{1}({\mathbb{T}})\times L^{2}({\mathbb{T}})) be a solution to the forced equation (1.3) and define the energy 444Indeed, under the (\xi,\eta)-coordinate this conservation is write as

\frac{1}{2}I(t)=\int\_{A-t}u\_{\xi}(t,x){\,\rm d}x+\int\_{B+t}u\_{\eta}(t,x){\,\rm
d%
}x.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | I(t)=\int\_{A-t}(u\_{x}+u\_{t})(t,x){\,\rm d}x+\int\_{B+t}(u\_{x}-u\_{t})(t,x){\,\rm d% }x. |  |

Then we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | I(t)=I(0),\;\forall t\in[0,T]. |  |

In the case |A|=|B|=2\pi, this conservation law is exactly the condition \int\_{{\mathbb{T}}}u\_{x}(t,x){\,\rm d}x=0.

###### Remark 1.2.

This proposition can be understood as a variant of Noether’s theorem555Noether’s theorem: “Every continuous symmetry of the action (or the equations of motion, in a suitable sense) implies a conserved quantity.” adapted to a controlled wave equation: a geometric symmetry of the forcing region yields a conserved functional of the solution. Indeed,
the key hypothesis is that the region G satisfies the observable symmetry condition for (A,B). The conclusion shows that the energy I(t) is invariant in time, regardless of the force term.

This new type of symmetry provides a necessary condition for the controllability and observability of (1.3), and even a necessary condition for the unique continuation of (1.2). See Section 2 for the detailed construction of counterexamples. Moreover, this construction gives rise to two classes of function pairs satisfying the symmetry condition, \mathcal{S}^{2}\_{c} and \mathcal{S}^{2}, in Definitions 2.7 and 2.9.
