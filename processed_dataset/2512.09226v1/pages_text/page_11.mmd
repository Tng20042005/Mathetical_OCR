if \min\_{l}\sum\_{k}d(\pi(k),\tau(k)+l)<n/3, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ||\Phi\_{2}(\pi)-\Phi\_{2}(\tau)||\_{1}\geq\dfrac{1}{8}\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}% diam\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\{0,l\}\cup\{p:\pi^{-1}(p)\neq\tau^{-1}(p-l)\}). |  |

Denote by \mathcal{J} the set of all intervals J=[a,b]=\{a,a+1,...,b\}\subset\mathbb{Z}/n and by J^{oo}:=[a+2,b-2] the double-interior of J (which is empty when |J|\leq 2).
Given any function f:J\to\mathbb{Z}/n and J=[a,b]\in\mathcal{J} we will write list(f,J) for the function

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | list(f,J):\{0,1,...,b-a\}\to\mathbb{Z}/n:k\mapsto f(k+a). |  |

Let \{v\_{k,f}\}\_{k,f} be a standard basis of l\_{1}^{N} where 1\leq k\leq n and f:\{0,1,...,k\}\to\mathbb{Z}/n is a function, and N\in\mathbb{N} is the number of pairs (k,f).
Define:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Phi\_{2}(\pi):=\dfrac{1}{n}\sum\_{J\in\mathcal{J}}1\_{\{0\notin J^{oo}\}}v\_{|J|,% list(\pi^{-1},J)}. |  |

The role of the notation list(\pi^{-1},J) is to record the permutation \pi^{-1} on the interval J but forget the starting point of the interval.
The above embedding is similar to the one in [33] except for this identification of the coordinates.
  
Upper Bound We show that \Phi\_{2} is Lipschitz with respect to the word metric. Fix \pi\in Sym\_{n}.
  
Across a transposition edge, \pi^{-1} and ((01)\pi)^{-1} are identical functions except at the points 0 and 1.
This means that for all J\in\mathcal{J} with

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \{0,1\}\cap J=\emptyset\iff v\_{|J|,list(\pi^{-1},J)}=v\_{|J|,list(((01)\pi)^{-1% },J)}. |  |

Also, if 0\in J^{oo}, then the coefficient of v\_{|J|,list(\pi^{-1},J)} will vanish and likewise for v\_{|J|,list(((01)\pi)^{-1},J)}.
There are at most 4n intervals J with \{0,1\}\cap J\neq\emptyset and 0\notin J^{oo}.
  
We conclude that ||\Phi\_{2}(\pi)-\Phi\_{2}((01)\pi)||\_{1}\leq 4.
  
Across a cyclic permutation edge
Observe that for all J\in\mathcal{J},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | list(\pi^{-1},J)=list((c\pi)^{-1},J+1), |  |

so the corresponding coordinates are identical.
The only way to get a nonzero summand in the l\_{1}^{N} norm is whenever 0\in J^{oo} and 0\notin(J+1)^{oo}=J^{oo}+1 or whenever 0\notin J^{oo} and 0\in(J+1)^{oo}=J^{oo}+1.
The number of such J is \leq 2n,
  
so we conclude that ||\Phi\_{2}(\pi)-\Phi\_{2}(c\pi)||\_{1}\leq 2.
  
Lower Bound
  
To avoid any ambiguity about the interval notation, in what follows, for all x,y,z\in\mathbb{Z}/n, we write x<y<z to say that the counterclockwise path from x to z passes through y.
Also, we use the notation J=[a,b]:=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}/n:a\leq x\leq b\}. (That way, for instance, [0,n-3] is an interval of size n-2 whereas [n-3,0] is an interval of size 4.)
{obs}
For any subset S\subset\mathbb{Z}/n with |S|\leq n/3 we have:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\{J\in\mathcal{J}|\emptyset\neq J\cap S\neq J\;and\;0\notin J^{oo}\}|\geq% \dfrac{n}{4}\;diam\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\{0\}\cup S). |  |

###### Proof.

For notational simplicity assume that n is even. We consider the points
