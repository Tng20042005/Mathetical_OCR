(i.e. properties that depend only on the linear structure of the finite dimensional subspaces).
An important early result is a metric characterization of Rademacher type 111Rademacher type is a fundamental invariant of the local geometry of a Banach spcae (see [30]). We do not need to recall it here in this paper, because we will not use it. through test spaces:
a Banach space X has trivial Rademacher type if and only if X contains the Hamming cubes with uniformly bounded bi-Lipschitz distortion, i.e.
\sup\_{n}c\_{X}((\{0,1\}^{n},||\cdot||\_{1}))<\infty.
The ”only if” direction follows from Pisier [42].
For the ”if” direction note the folklore result that for every 0<\epsilon<1 and every finite subset F\subset L\_{1}, F embeds into \{0,1\}^{n} with distortion 1+\epsilon for some n\in\mathbb{N} (this follows from a standard approximation argument; see for instance the proof of Lemma 5.4 in [31]).
By Ribe’s theorem [44] (see also [6] for quantitative bounds), taking an \epsilon-net of the unit ball of any finite dimensional subspace of L\_{1} we see that L\_{1} is crudely finitely representable in X, hence X has trivial Rademacher type.
(Almost sharp quantitative bounds for this metric characterization of type follow from [7] and truly sharp bounds follow from [21].)

A sequence of metric spaces ((M\_{n},d\_{n}))\_{n} is a family of test spaces for a Banach space Z whenever for all Banach spaces X we have that Z is finitely representable in X if and only if \sup\_{n}c\_{X}((M\_{n},d\_{n}))<\infty [40].
Ostrovskii [36, 35] showed that for any Banach space Z there exists a family of 3-regular graphs whose shortest-path metrics form a family of test spaces for Z.
However, these test spaces are not vertex-transitive, even for L\_{1}.

A theorem of Naor and Peres [33] states that the lamplighter groups \mathbb{Z}/n\wr\mathbb{Z}/n with the standard generators (either move the pointer by a unit or edit the current lamp by a unit) embed into L\_{1} with uniformly bounded bi-Lipschitz distortion.
On the other hand, Arzhantseva, Guba and Sapir [2] showed that every Hamming cube \{0,1\}^{n} embeds into \mathbb{Z}/m\wr\mathbb{Z}/m for some m with uniformly bounded bi-Lipschitz distortion.
It follows that the sequence of 4-regular Cayley graphs of (\mathbb{Z}/n\wr\mathbb{Z}/n)\_{n} form test spaces for Rademacher type.
As an application of Theorem 1, we have a new example of bounded degree Cayley test spaces of Rademacher type which are 3-regular and are Cayley graphs of the symmetric groups.

### 1.3. L\_{2}-embeddings of Cayley graphs into Hilbert space

.
  
A conjecture of Cornulier-Tessera-Valette [11] states that a finitely generated group whose word metric embeds bi-Lipschitzly into Hilbert space must have an abelian subgroup of finite index.
In Section 7, we state a version of this conjecture due to Naor about finite groups, and prove that a positive answer to the conjecture of Cornulier-Tessera-Valette implies a positive answer to the conjecture of Naor.
One should view Section 7 as the Euclidean counterpart to Question 1.
This section also contains several results and conjectures due to Naor which appear for the first time with his permission.

### 1.4. Overview of the proof of Theorem 1 and paper organization

.
  
In Section 2 we begin with an explicit formula for the word metric of (Sym\_{n},\{c,t\}) up to constant factors.
The formula is inspired by the word metric formula of Yadin for the lampshuffler groups [45].
The lampshuffler group Sym\_{00}(\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z} consists of all pairs (\pi,x) where \pi is a finite support permutation on \mathbb{Z} and x\in\mathbb{Z} is a pointer.
Roughly speaking, this is a variation of the lamplighter on \mathbb{Z}, but the generator moves are: just moving the pointer and moving the pointer while transposing the two elements along the movement.
In fact, it is not hard to show that the lampshuffler group Sym\_{00}(\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z} embeds bi-Lipschitzly into L\_{1} (see [25]).
