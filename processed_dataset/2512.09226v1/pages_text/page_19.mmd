Therefore subgroup H\_{n}\leq G\_{n} is abelian for all n>n\_{0}.

Combining Proposition 7 and Proposition 7, we get:

{coro}

The conjecture of Cornulier-Tessera-Valette (Conjecture 7)
  
implies the finite version of Naor (Conjecture 7).

It is natural to ask the following L\_{2}-variant of Ostrovkii’s Question 1:
Does there exist r\in\mathbb{N} and generating sets T\_{n}\subset Sym\_{n} each of size |T\_{n}|\leq r such that
\sup\_{n}c\_{2}(\Gamma(Sym\_{n},d\_{T\_{n}}))<\infty?
Assuming Conjecture 7 the answer is no.
The same negative answer follows from the following conjecture:

{conj}

[Naor]
For any r\in\mathbb{N} and M>0 there exists n\in\mathbb{N} such that
for any generating set T\_{n} of Sym\_{n} of size |T\_{n}|\leq r we have the following super-diffusive drift estimate for the simple random walk \{W\_{t}\}\_{t=1}^{\infty} on \Gamma(Sym\_{n},T\_{n}) starting at W\_{0}=1:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{t\in\mathbb{N}}\dfrac{\mathbb{E}\;d\_{T\_{n}}(1,W\_{t})^{2}}{t}>M. |  |

Potentially, stronger super-diffusivity estimates hold.
Using Markov type 2 as in Linial-Magen-Naor [27] (alternatively see Chapter 8 in [40] or Chapter 13 in [28])
Conjecture 7 implies that for any r\in\mathbb{N} and any sequence of generating sets \{T\_{n}\subset Sym\_{n}\} of size |T\_{n}|\leq r we have
\sup\_{n}c\_{2}(Sym\_{n},d\_{T\_{n}})=\infty.

Next, we verify Conjecture 7 for specific generating sets of the symmetric groups.

Let T\_{n}=\{(0123...n-1),(01)\} is the cycle and the transposition.
Then one checks that the ball of radius n/4 of Sym\_{n} is graph-isomorphic to the ball of radius n/4 of the 1D lampshuffler group Sym\_{oo}(\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z} with standard generators [45].
(In other words, we have local convergence.)
By a theorem of Yadin [45], the simple random walk on Sym\_{oo}(\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z} has drift exponent 3/4.
This means that for small times the same estimate holds on the symmetric group:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{E}d(1,W\_{t})\gtrsim t^{3/4}\;\;\;for\;all\;1\leq t\leq n/4. |  |

In what follows, we need to recall the following Basic Fact:
The random walk \{W\_{t}\}\_{t=1}^{\infty} on an n-vertex degree d graph \Gamma with spectral gap 1-\lambda satisfies:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{E}d(W\_{0},W\_{t})\gtrsim\_{d,\lambda}t\;\;\;for\;all\;0\leq t\lesssim\_{d% ,\lambda}\log n, |  |

where d(\cdot,\cdot) is the shortest path metric on \Gamma, and we have suppressed the dependence on the degree d and the spectral gap 1-\lambda.
(This estimate goes back to Theorem 5 in Kesten [23]; see also Proposition 6.9 in [28].).

Let T\_{n} be the generating set from Kassabov’s theorem.
The Cayley graphs are expanders, so Conjecture 7 is verified by the above fact.
