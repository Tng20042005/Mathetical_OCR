Classify (sequences of) groups \{G\_{n}\} according to the above trichotomy.
Namely, obtain a useful structural characterization of when they exhibit never, always or mixed L\_{1} behavior.

In particular, Naor highlighted the following concrete particular case of Question 1, which could be quite tractable and enlightening to resolve: into which part of the above trichotomy do the lamplighter groups \{\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\wr\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\}\_{n} fall?

A landmark result of Kassabov [22] states that there exists a sequence of generating sets T\_{n}\subset Sym\_{n} of the symmetric groups of bounded size, \sup\_{n}|T\_{n}|<\infty, such that the Cayley graphs \{\Gamma(Sym\_{n},T\_{n})\}\_{n} form a family of expanders.
In light of Kassabov’s theorem, Ostrovskii asked the following question [41] which was subsequently posted in [37].
{qst}[Ostrovskii]
Do there exist C\in(0,\infty) and r\in\mathbb{N} and generating sets T\_{n}\subset Sym\_{n} each of size |T\_{n}|\leq r such that for each n, the symmetric group with word metric (Sym\_{n},d\_{T\_{n}}) embeds into L\_{1} with bi-Lipschitz distortion \leq C?

We give a positive answer to Question 1.
Combined with Kassabov’s theorem (and the well-known fact that bounded degree expander graphs do not embed bi-Lipschitzly into L\_{1} [26]),
we conclude that the symmetric groups \{Sym\_{n}\}\_{n=1}^{\infty} exhibit Mixed-L\_{1} behavior.

{theo}

[Cycle and transposition live in L\_{1}].
  
For any n\in\mathbb{N}, the symmetric group Sym\_{n} on \mathbb{Z}/n endowed with the word metric generated by the transposition t:=(01) and the cycle c:=(0123...n-1)
  
embeds into L\_{1} with bi-Lipschitz distortion O(1). Specifically, we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}c\_{1}(Sym\_{n},d\_{\{t,c\}})<1000. |  |

The constant 1000 is not optimized.

It is well-known that \Gamma(Sym\_{n},\{t,c\}) is not an expander (e.g. see Remark 2 on page 510 in [4] or Section 11.4 in the survey [20]).
Theorem 1 implies that \Gamma(Sym\_{n},\{t,c\}) is very far from being an expander in the following strong sense.

{coro}

[Coarse opposite to Kassabov’s theorem]
.
  
The sequence of Cayley graphs \{\Gamma(Sym\_{n},\{t,c\})\}\_{n} cannot contain coarsely an unbounded sequence of bounded degree expanders.
That is, given two increasing functions \alpha,\beta:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty) with \lim\_{t\to\infty}\alpha(t)=\infty,
and a finite graph \Gamma with (normalized) spectral gap 1-\lambda and maximum degree \Delta,
if there exists f:\Gamma\to Sym\_{n} with

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \alpha(d\_{\Gamma}(u,v))\leq d\_{\{c,t\}}(f(u),f(v))\leq\beta(d\_{\Gamma}(u,v))\;% \;\;for\;all\;u,v\in V(\Gamma) |  |

(where d\_{\Gamma} denotes the shortest path metric on \Gamma and d\_{\{c,t\}} the word metric on Sym\_{n}),
  
then the number of vertices in \Gamma is bounded:
