We have two further subcases:
  
CASE B1: The minimum of T\_{2} is attained at the same value l as the minimum of T\_{1}.
  
In this case the claim is trivial (since the left-hand side equals T\_{1}+T\_{2}).
  
CASE B2: The minimum of T\_{2} is attained at a different value l^{\prime}\neq l than the minimum of T\_{1}.
  
In this case, as we saw above, T\_{2}>n/2 and we get:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T\_{1}+T\_{2}>\dfrac{n}{2}+T\_{1}=\dfrac{n}{2}+\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k\in% \mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-l,\tau(k)) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \geq\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\left(\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k% )-l,\tau(k))+diam\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\{0,l\}\cup\{p:\pi^{-1}(p)\neq\tau^{-1}(p-l)% \})\right). |  |

(Aside: since the resulting inequality is strict, CASE B2 can never happen.)

## 4. Embedding the 1st term: distance to the median

There exists a map \Phi\_{1}:Sym\_{n}\to L\_{1} such that for all \pi,\tau\in Sym\_{n} we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ||\Phi\_{1}(\pi)-\Phi\_{1}(\tau)||\_{1}\asymp\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k\in% \mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-l,\tau(k)). |  |

In particular, the bi-Lipschitz distortion is <2\pi\approx 6.28.

The following observation is well-known (e.g. see [43]).

For any metric space (X,d) and any x\_{1},...,x\_{n}\in X

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\sum\_{j=1}^{n}d(x\_{i},x\_{j})\leq\min% \_{1\leq r\leq n}\dfrac{1}{n}\sum\_{j=1}^{n}d(x\_{r},x\_{j})\leq\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}% \sum\_{i=1}^{n}\sum\_{j=1}^{n}d(x\_{i},x\_{j}). |  |

###### Proof.

The second inequality is trivial since the minimum of a list of numbers is always \leq the average.
For the first inequality, for all r\in[n] we use the triangle inequality:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dfrac{1}{n^{2}}\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\sum\_{j=1}^{n}d(x\_{i},x\_{j})\leq\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}% \sum\_{i=1}^{n}\sum\_{j=1}^{n}(d(x\_{r},x\_{j})+d(x\_{r},x\_{j}))=\dfrac{2}{n}\sum\_{% j=1}^{n}d(x\_{r},x\_{j}) |  |

For any n,m\in\mathbb{N} and x\_{1},...,x\_{m}\in\mathbb{Z}/n we have:
