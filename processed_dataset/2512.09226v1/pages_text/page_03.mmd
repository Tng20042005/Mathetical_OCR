where C>0 is a universal constant.

The proof that Theorem 1 implies Corollary 1 follows from Gromov [18] and it is a standard argument nowadays (see Theorem 5.7 and the proof of Theorem 4.9 in [40]).
Note that the dependence on the max-degree \Delta is necessary: \{\Gamma(Sym\_{n},\{t,c\})\}\_{n} contain the Hamming cubes bi-Lipschitzly which are unbounded degree spectral expanders (see Subsection 1.2 and Section 8).

### 1.1. Background

The L\_{1} bi-Lipschitz distortion of a metric space (\mathcal{M},d), denoted by c\_{1}(\mathcal{M}), is the infimal D>1 for which there exists a map f:\mathcal{M}\to L\_{1} with

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d(x,y)\leq||f(x)-f(y)||\_{1}\leq D\;d(x,y)\;\;\;for\;all\;x,y\in\mathcal{M}. |  |

Understanding the smallest possible distortion D>1 for embedding a metric space is a central question in the theory of metric embeddings (see for instance [29, 40, 32, 12, 20]).
The question is equivalent to bi-Lipschitz approximation by a measured walls structure which has been fruitfully investigated in the context of geometric group theory
(see for example Prop. 2.6 in [10], [9], Chapter 6 in [15] and references within).

For a Banach space X, the bi-Lipschitz distortion c\_{X}(\mathcal{M}) is defined analogously. When X=L\_{2} we write c\_{2}(\mathcal{M}):=c\_{L\_{2}}(\mathcal{M}).
L\_{2}-distortion will be discussed in Section 7.
(We remark that for finite metric spaces, whether the target space is L\_{1}([0,1]) or l\_{1}(\mathbb{N}) makes no difference. For every \epsilon>0, any finite dimensional subspace of one L\_{1}-space is (1+\epsilon)-isomorphic to some finite dimensional subspace of the other L\_{1}-space. The same remark holds for L\_{2}.)

Notation:
For each n\in\mathbb{N} let Sym\_{n} be the symmetric group on \mathbb{Z}/n=\{0,1,2,...,n-1\}, t=(01) be the transposition of the first two elements and c=(0123...n-1) be the cyclic permutation.
We consider the (left) Cayley graphs of the symmetric groups \Gamma(Sym\_{n},\{t,c\}) with vertices Sym\_{n} and edges \{(t\pi,\pi),(c\pi,\pi):\pi\in Sym\_{n}\} and view Sym\_{n} as a metric space endowed with the shortest path metric (that is, the word metric).
We denote the metric by d(\cdot,\cdot) and the distance to the identity (or word length) by |\cdot|.
We will write: S:=\{t,c\} for the generating set.
For each k,l\in\mathbb{Z}/n we denote by d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(k,l) the distance between k and l on the Cayley graph of \mathbb{Z}/n generated by \{+1\}.
Finally, the product of two permutations is read from right to left, as in function composition.
This means that, for instance, (12)(23)=(123) and (23)(12)=(132).

Remark: It is well-known that if we do not insist that the generating sets are of bounded size, then it is easy to embed the symmetric groups into L\_{1}.
For each n, take the generating set of all transpositions.
Map f:Sym\_{n}\to l\_{1}([n]^{2}) by mapping each permutation \pi to its associated permutation matrix A\_{\pi}.
Whenever two permutations differ by a transposition, their difference in the image is exactly 2.
By the triangle inequality, this gives the upper bound ||A\_{\pi}-A\_{\tau}||\_{1}\leq 2d(\pi,\tau) for any \pi,\tau\in Sym\_{n}.
For the lower bound, observe that ||A\_{\pi}-A\_{\tau}||\_{1}=||Id-A\_{\tau\pi^{-1}}||\_{1} so it suffices to show ||Id-A\_{\pi}||\gtrsim d(1,\pi).
Observe that by our choice of generating set, d(1,\pi)=\#\{k\in[n]:\pi(k)\neq k\}-\#\{cycles\;of\;\pi\} and also ||Id-A\_{\pi}||\_{1}=2\#\{k\in[n]:\pi(k)\neq k\}; so the lower bound also follows.
