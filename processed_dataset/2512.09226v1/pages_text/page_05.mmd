In the symmetric group Sym\_{n}, the cycle c plays the role of the ”pointer” and t takes the role of the transposition generator
(though no knowledge of lamplighter nor lampshufflers is required for the proof).

The key difficulty in analyzing the word metric on Sym\_{n} as opposed to Sym\_{00}(\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z} (or even Sym\_{00}(\mathbb{Z}/n)\ltimes\mathbb{Z}/n) is that the pointer (or frame of reference) is ambiguous.
For example, whenever \pi=c^{2}tctc^{-4} then it is obvious that the ”pointer” should be -1, but for a more complicated permutation this is not clear.
The first step of the proof is to show that the distance between two permutations \pi and \tau is given by:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\tau\pi^{-1}|\asymp\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\left(\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{% \mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-l,\tau(k))+diam\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\{0,l\}\cup\{p:\pi^{-1}(p)% \neq\tau^{-1}(p-l)\})\right) |  |

where d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n} denotes the distance on the n-cycle \mathbb{Z}/n.
Observe that we have to take the minimum over all potential ”pointer positions” l\in\mathbb{N}.

The presence of this minimum makes the metric difficult to analyze.

In Section 3 we split the minimum of the sum of two terms into the sum of two minimums:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\tau\pi^{-1}|\asymp\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{\mathbb{Z% }/n}(\pi(k)-l,\tau(k))+\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}diam\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\{0,l\}\cup% \{p:\pi^{-1}(p)\neq\tau^{-1}(p-l)\})=:T\_{1}+T\_{2} |  |

This is achieved by high-low casework.
Whenever T\_{1}<n/3, for some l there are at most n/3 nonzero terms in the sum, so the ”potential pointer” is obvious, and the same value l will be the optimal one in all three minimums.
Whenever T\_{1}>n/3, the first term dominates.
This is because we always have T\_{2}\leq n/2 (since it is a diameter) and hence: T\_{1}\leq T\_{2}\leq(1+3/2)T\_{2}.
The rest of the proof deals with embedding each term separately.

The first term,
\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-l,\tau(k)),
is a metric on Sym\_{n} and can be viewed as a subset of the abelian group [n-1]^{\mathbb{Z}/n} (where addition is pointwise addition of functions f:[n-1]\to\mathbb{Z}/n) with word metric given by the generating set \{(1,0,...,0),(0,1,0,...,),...,(0,...,0,1),(1,1,...,1)\}.
We follow the embedding method of Austin-Naor-Valette [3] (see also section 4 in Naor-Peres [33]),
and write the embedding into L\_{1} using the representation theory of abelian groups (that is, exponential sums).
We interpret

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-l,\tau(k% ))=\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}/n}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-\tau(% k),l) |  |

as the minimum sum of distances of the cloud of points \{\pi(k)-\tau(k)\} to a ”median” point l\in\mathbb{Z}/n.
It is well-known (e.g. see [43]) that
this quantity is, up to a factor of 2, the average distance of the cloud of points.
Based on this observation, we construct the embedding via exponential sums.
(Sidenote: similar to how [3] and [33] proceed, the embedding was found by reverse-engineering: first searching through all possible L\_{2}-representations of this abelian group and pointing out which representations will not work.)

The second term,
\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}diam\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\{0,l\}\cup\{p:\pi^{-1}(p)\neq\tau^%
{-1}(p-l)\})
is a variation of the lamplighter metric, but in which the lamplighter has ”forgotten his position”.
It was shown by Naor-Peres [33] that the lamplighter metric embeds into L\_{1}. (Later Ostrovskii-Randrianantoanina [38] gave a different embedding which works more generally into any non-superreflexive Banach space.)
Here we modify the second embedding given in Naor-Peres by identifying/collapsing certain specific coordinates of l\_{1}(\mathbb{N}).
Whenever the first term is small, e.g. T\_{1}<n/3, the optimal ”pointer” l is obvious, and the coordinate identifications do not ”influence” the lower bound of the embedding.

In Section 6 we combine the estimates for each of the two terms and prove Theorem 1.

In Section 7 we discuss L\_{2}-embeddings of Cayley graphs into Hilbert space.
