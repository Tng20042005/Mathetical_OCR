L\_{1} and L\_{2} embeddings of the symmetric group

# L\_{1} and L\_{2} embeddings of the symmetric group

Cosmas Kravaris

###### Abstract.

We show that the Cayley graph of the symmetric group Sym\_{n} generated by the cycle (123...n) and the transposition (12) embeds into L\_{1} with bi-Lipschitz distortion O(1).
This answers a question of Ostrovskii, and along with Kassabov’s theorem gives the first example of a sequence of groups which embed bi-Lipschitzly into L\_{1} for one choice of bounded size generating sets, but not for another choice of bounded size generating sets.
In particular, the Cayley graphs generated by the cycle and the transposition cannot contain coarsely any unbounded sequence of expander graphs.
Moreover, within the context of the Ribe program, they are a new example of bounded degree Cayley graphs which are test spaces for Rademacher type.

## 1. Introduction

The rank of a finitely generated group G, denoted by rank(G), is the smallest size of a generating set of G.
Given a group G with a finite generating set S, denote by c\_{1}(G,d\_{S}) the bi-Lipschitz distortion of the shortest path metric d\_{S} of the Cayley graph \Gamma(G,S) into L\_{1} (see the background below).

We start with the following observation and fundamental question, shown to us by Naor.
A sequence of finite groups \{G\_{n}\}\_{n} of bounded rank, \sup\_{n}rank(G\_{n})<\infty, tautologically exhibits one of the following three behaviors:
  
Never-L\_{1} behavior: For any sequence of generating sets \{S\_{n}\subset G\_{n}\}\_{n}
with \sup\_{n}|S\_{n}|<\infty,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}c\_{1}(G\_{n},d\_{S\_{n}})=\infty. |  |

Always-L\_{1} behavior: For any sequence of generating sets \{S\_{n}\subset G\_{n}\}\_{n} with \sup\_{n}|S\_{n}|<\infty,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}c\_{1}(G\_{n},d\_{S\_{n}})<\infty. |  |

Mixed-L\_{1} behavior: There exist two sequences of generating sets \{S\_{n}\subset G\_{n}\}\_{n} and \{S^{\prime}\_{n}\subset G\_{n}\}\_{n} with \sup\_{n}|S\_{n}|<\infty and \sup\_{n}|S^{\prime}\_{n}|<\infty such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}c\_{1}(G\_{n},d\_{S\_{n}})<\infty\;\;\;and\;\;\;\sup\_{n}c\_{1}(G\_{n},d\_{S^{% \prime}\_{n}})=\infty. |  |

The existence of a sequence of groups with Never-L\_{1} behavior
follows from a theorem of Breuillard and Gamburd [8],
and the well-known fact that expander graphs do not embed bi-Lipschitzly into L\_{1} [26].
It was shown to us by Naor that bounded rank abelian groups exhibit Always-L\_{1} behavior (see Proposition 7 in Section 7).
See Section 7 for the L\_{2}-counterparts of these behaviors.
  
The main result of this paper, see Theorem 1 below, provides the first example of a sequence of groups with Mixed-L\_{1} behavior.
