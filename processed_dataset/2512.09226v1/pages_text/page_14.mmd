## 7. Remarks on embedding groups into Hilbert space

This section contains results of Naor and are included with his permission.
Given a metric space (X,d) denote by c\_{2}(X,d) the infimal bi-Lipschitz distortion of X into Hilbert space L\_{2}.

{conj}

[Cornulier-Tessera-Valette [11]]
.
  
Let G be a finitely generated group with a word metric d\_{S}.
We have:
  
c\_{2}(G,d\_{S})<\infty
\iff G has an abelian subgroup of finite index.

The following is a finite version of this conjecture.
Given a set X and r\in\mathbb{N} we write X\choose r for the collection of all subsets of X of size r.

{conj}

[Naor]
Let \{G\_{n}\}\_{n} be a sequence of finite groups with \sup\_{n}rank(G\_{n})<\infty.
The following five conditions are equivalent:
  
1. For all r>\sup\_{n}rank(G\_{n}), all Cayley graphs of \{G\_{n}\}\_{n} with r generators embed into Hilbert space with uniformly bounded distortion:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}\sup\_{S\in{G\_{n}\choose r}\;:\;<S>=G\_{n}}c\_{2}(G\_{n},d\_{S})<\infty |  |

2. There exists r\in\mathbb{N} such that all Cayley graphs of \{G\_{n}\}\_{n} with r generators embed into Hilbert space with uniformly bounded distortion:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}\sup\_{S\in{G\_{n}\choose r}\;:\;<S>=G\_{n}}c\_{2}(G\_{n},d\_{S})<\infty |  |

3. For all r>\sup\_{n}rank(G\_{n}) there exists a generating set of size r, S\_{n}, for each G\_{n}, such that the Cayley graphs embed into Hilbert space with uniformly bounded distortion:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}\inf\_{S\in{G\_{n}\choose r}\;:\;<S>=G\_{n}}c\_{2}(G\_{n},d\_{S})<\infty |  |

4. There exists r\in\mathbb{N} and a generating set of size r, S\_{n}, for each G\_{n}, such that the Cayley graphs embed into Hilbert space with uniformly bounded distortion:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}\inf\_{S\in{G\_{n}\choose r}\;:\;<S>=G\_{n}}c\_{2}(G\_{n},d\_{S})<\infty |  |

5. There exists r\in\mathbb{N} and a rank \leq r abelian subgroup H\_{n}\leq G\_{n} for each G\_{n} such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{n}[G\_{n}:H\_{n}]<\infty. |  |

In this conjecture, of course (1)\implies(2)\&(3), and (2)\implies(4) and (3)\implies(4).
The direction (5)\implies(1) is not immediate, since one has to deal with arbitrary generating sets of abelian groups.
Nonetheless, it is true:

{prop}

[Naor]
In the above conjecture, (5)\implies(1).
  
That is, for each r\in\mathbb{N} and K\in\mathbb{N} there exists D>1 such that
  
If G is a finite group which has an abelian subgroup H\leq G of index [G:H]\leq K, and S=\{s\_{1},...,s\_{r}\} is a generating set of G
then c\_{2}(G,d\_{S})\leq D.
