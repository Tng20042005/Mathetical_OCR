Since L\_{2} embeds bi-Lipschitzly into L\_{1},
Proposition 7 implies that abelian groups of bounded rank exhibit Always-L\_{1} behavior.
Also, the proof below gives the dependence D\lesssim\_{K}r^{3/2}\log r.
It would be interesting to know the optimal dependence on r in Proposition 7 (see also Conjecture 7 below).

###### Proof.

CASE 1: G is abelian
  
The word metric of y\in G is given by:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d(y,0)=\min\{\sum\_{i=1}^{r}|k\_{i}|:y=\sum\_{i=1}^{r}k\_{i}s\_{i},\;\;\;k\_{1},...,% k\_{r}\in\mathbb{Z}\}. |  |

Consider \Lambda:=kernel\{k\mapsto\;\;\sum\_{i=1}^{r}k\_{i}s\_{i}\}
which is the kernel of a map \mathbb{Z}^{r}\to G and a lattice of rank \leq r.
We may write our group as the direct product of cyclic ones G=\oplus\_{j=1}^{J}\mathbb{Z}\_{m\_{j}} and pick canonical generators e\_{1},...,e\_{J}, where e\_{j}=(\delta\_{jj^{\prime}})\_{j^{\prime}=1}^{J} is a generator for \mathbb{Z}/m\_{j}.
We write each of the canonical generators in terms of the generators s\_{1},...,s\_{r}: there exist (a\_{i}^{(j)})\_{i=1}^{r}\in\mathbb{Z}^{r} for each j\in[J] such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | e\_{j}=\sum\_{i=1}^{r}a\_{i}^{(j)}s\_{i}\;\;\;for\;all\;j\in[J]. |  |

That way, given any g=\sum\_{j=1}^{J}g\_{j}e\_{j}\in G, we have:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g=\sum\_{i=1}^{r}\left(\sum\_{j=1}^{J}g\_{j}a\_{i}^{(j)}\right)s\_{i}. |  |

Now, if we have any element (k\_{1},...,k\_{r})\in\Lambda, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g=\sum\_{i=1}^{r}\left(k\_{i}+\sum\_{j=1}^{J}g\_{j}a\_{i}^{(j)}\right)s\_{i}. |  |

Conversely, for any two representations

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g=\sum\_{i=1}^{r}k\_{i}s\_{i}=\sum\_{i=1}^{r}k\_{i}^{\prime}s\_{i}\implies(k\_{i}-k\_{% i}^{\prime})\_{i=1}^{r}\in\Lambda. |  |

Writing (Ag)\_{i}:=\sum\_{j=1}^{J}g\_{j}a\_{i}^{(j)} for each i\in[r], we conclude that the word metric is given by:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d\_{word}(g,0)=\min\_{k\in\Lambda}\sum\_{i=1}^{r}|k\_{i}-\sum\_{j=1}^{J}g\_{j}a\_{i}^% {(j)}|=\min\_{k\in\Lambda}||k-Ag||\_{l\_{1}^{r}}. |  |

Form the flat torus {}^{r}/\Lambda which is a Riemannian manifold (with universal cover {}^{r}) and the Riemannian metric is inherited from the standard Riemannian metric on the cover {}^{r}.
The metric on the flat torus is given by the formula

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d\_{{}^{r}/\Lambda}(x+\Lambda,y+\Lambda):=\min\_{z\in\Lambda}||x-y+z||\_{l\_{2}^{r% }}, |  |

so by the Cauchy-Schwarz \leq and the above observation, we get that for all g\_{1},g\_{2}\in G,
