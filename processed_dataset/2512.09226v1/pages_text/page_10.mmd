Let l be a minimizer for \min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k=1}^{m}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k},l).
If l\in\{x\_{1},...,x\_{m}\} then we are done, so suppose not.
Consider the antipodal point \bar{l}:=\lfloor n/2\rfloor+l and the two intervals [l,\bar{l}] and [\bar{l},l] whose union is the whole circle \mathbb{Z}/n.
Without loss of generality, assume that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | |\{x\_{1},...,x\_{m}\}\cap[\bar{l},l]|\geq|\{x\_{1},...,x\_{m}\}\cap[l,\bar{l}]|. |  |

Let x\_{r}\in\{x\_{1},...,x\_{m}\}\cap[\bar{l},l] be the point in \{x\_{1},...,x\_{m}\}\cap[\bar{l},l] which is closest to l.
We claim that x\_{r} is also a midpoint:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{k=1}^{m}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k},x\_{r})=\sum\_{x\_{k}\in[\bar{l},l]}^{m}d\_{% \mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k},x\_{r})+\sum\_{x\_{k}\in(\bar{l},l]}^{m}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k% },x\_{r}) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \leq\sum\_{x\_{k}\in[\bar{l},l]}^{m}(d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k},l)-d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(% x\_{r},l))+\sum\_{x\_{k}\in(\bar{l},l]}^{m}(d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k},l)+d\_{\mathbb{% Z}/n}(x\_{r},l)) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | =\sum\_{k=1}^{m}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k},l)-d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{r},l)\left(|\{x\_{% 1},...,x\_{m}\}\cap[\bar{l},l]|-|\{x\_{1},...,x\_{m}\}\cap[l,\bar{l}]|\right)\leq% \sum\_{k=1}^{m}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(x\_{k},l). |  |

###### Proof for embedding the first term in L\_{1}.

We map \Phi\_{1}:Sym\_{n}\to l\_{1}^{n^{2}} by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Phi\_{1}(\pi):=\left(e^{2\pi i(\pi(k)-\pi(r))/n}\right)\_{k,r\in[n]}\;\;\;for\;% all\;\pi\in Sym\_{n}. |  |

For all \pi,\tau\in Sym\_{n} we have:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ||\Phi\_{1}(\pi)-\Phi\_{1}(\tau)||\_{1}=\sum\_{k}\sum\_{r}|e^{2\pi i(\pi(k)-\pi(r))% /n}-e^{2\pi i(\tau(k)-\tau(r))/n}| |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \asymp\sum\_{k}\sum\_{r}\dfrac{1}{n}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-\pi(r),\tau(k)-\tau(% r))=\dfrac{1}{n}\sum\_{k}\sum\_{r}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-\tau(k),\pi(r)-\tau(r)) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \asymp\min\_{r}\sum\_{k}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-\tau(k),\pi(r)-\tau(r))=\min\_{l% \in\mathbb{Z}/n}\sum\_{k}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/n}(\pi(k)-\tau(k),l). |  |

Finally, observe that in each of the two \asymp steps we pay factors \pi and 2 respectively.
