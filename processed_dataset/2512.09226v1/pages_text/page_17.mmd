Finally, we construct the embedding.
From CASE 1, we can find f:H\to L\_{2} with distortion O\_{r}(1).
Let ([J],d\_{trivial}) be the trivial metric on [J], where any two distinct points have distance 1.
(This metric embeds isometrically into Hilbert space as the vertices of the standard simplex.)
Map F:G\to L\_{2}\times[J]:k\_{j}h\to(f(h),j).
We check that for each k\_{j}h,k\_{j^{\prime}}h^{\prime}\in G.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dfrac{1}{2[G:H]+1}d\_{H,T^{\prime}}(h,h^{\prime})+1\_{\{j=j^{\prime}\}}\leq d\_{% G,T}(k\_{j}h,k\_{j^{\prime}}h^{\prime})\leq[G:H]1\_{\{j=j^{\prime}\}}+d\_{H,T^{% \prime}}(h,h^{\prime}) |  |

and hence we get an embedding of G into L\_{2} whose distortion depends only on r and [G:H].

One of the main results of Khot-Naor [24], answering a question of W. B. Johnson,
is that there exists a lattice \Lambda\leq{}^{r} such that c\_{1}(l\_{2}^{r}/\Lambda)\gtrsim\sqrt{r}.
Case 1 in the proof of Proposition 7 yields the following strengthening of this result.

{prop}

[Naor]
For every r\in\mathbb{N} there exists a lattice \Lambda\subset{}^{r} such that
c\_{1}(l\_{1}^{r}/\Lambda)\gtrsim r, where the metric on l\_{1}^{r}/\Lambda is given by:
d(x+\Lambda,y+\Lambda):=\inf\_{k\in\Lambda}||x-y+k||\_{1} for all x,y\in{}^{r}.
  
By Cauchy-Schwarz, this implies c\_{1}(l\_{2}^{r}/\Lambda)\gtrsim\sqrt{r}

###### Proof.

The proof is probabilistic.
Recall the following special case of the Alon-Roichman theorem [1].
There exists a constant c>0 for which
we sample r iid elements S=\{s\_{1},...,s\_{r}\} uniformly at random from G=(\mathbb{Z}/2)^{\lfloor cr\rfloor}.
Then with probability >1/2, the Cayley graph \Gamma(G,S) has Cheeger constant >1/10.
  
Consider the map \mathbb{Z}^{r}\to G:(k\_{i})\_{i=1}^{r}\mapsto\sum\_{i=1}^{n}k\_{i}s\_{i} and its kernel \Lambda:=kernel(k\mapsto\sum\_{s\in S}k\_{s}s) which is a random lattice \Lambda\leq{}^{r}.
As we saw in Case 1 in the proof of Proposition 7,
the shortest path metric on \Gamma(G,S) embeds isometrically into the l\_{1}-torus l\_{1}^{r}/\Lambda.
We show c\_{1}(\Gamma(G,S)) is large.
  
By Propositions 3.4 and 3.5 in Newmann-Rabinovich [34] we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dfrac{1}{|G|^{2}}\sum\_{g\in G}\sum\_{h\in G}d\_{word}(x,y)\geq\dfrac{diam(% \Gamma(G,S))}{2}-1\gtrsim r. |  |

(The first estimate is immediate: consider the smallest r such that B|(1,r)|>|G|/2. Then LHS\geq r-1\geq diam(\Gamma(G,S))/2-1. The second estimate follows from counting all possible small geodesics in an abelian group; see [34] for details.)
  
Fix any D>1 and f:\Gamma(G,S)\to L\_{1} with d(g,h)\leq||f(g)-f(h)||\_{1}\leq Dd(g,h) for all g,h\in G.
By the L\_{1}-Poincare inequality for the Cheeger constant (i.e. Theorem 4.7 in [40]), we have with probability >1/2 that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | r\lesssim\dfrac{1}{|G|^{2}}\sum\_{g\in G}\sum\_{h\in G}||f(g)-f(h)||\_{1}\leq% \dfrac{20}{|E(\Gamma)|}\sum\_{(g,h)\in E(\Gamma)}||f(g)-f(h)||\_{1}\leq 20D. |  |

We conclude that
c\_{1}(l\_{1}^{r}/\Lambda)\geq c\_{1}(\Gamma(G,S))\gtrsim r with probability >1/2.
∎

The following conjecture is an L\_{1}-analogue of the result of Haviv-Regev [19]:
{conj}[Naor]
There exists c>0 such that for any r\in\mathbb{N} and any lattice \Lambda\subset{}^{n}:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | c\_{1}(l\_{1}^{r}/\Lambda)\lesssim r(\log r)^{c}. |  |

A positive answer would imply that Proposition 7 is sharp up to logarithmic factors. Perhaps the conjecture is true without the logarithmic factors.

We return to bi-Lipschitz embeddings of groups into Hilbert space.

{prop}

.
  
Assuming conjecture 1, the direction (4)\implies(5) in conjecture 2 follows, that is:
  
If \{G\_{n}\}\_{n} are finite groups and \{S\_{n}\}\_{n} generating sets of size =r with \sup\_{n}c\_{2}(G\_{n},d\_{S\_{n}})<\infty,
  
then each G\_{n} has an abelian subgroup H\_{n} such that \sup\_{n}[G\_{n}:H\_{n}]<\infty.
