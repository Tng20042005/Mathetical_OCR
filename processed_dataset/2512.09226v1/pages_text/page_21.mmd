For each n\in\mathbb{N}, the Hamming cube (\{0,1\}^{n},||\cdot||\_{1}) embeds into \Gamma(Sym\_{4n^{2}},\{c,t\}) with bi-Lipschitz distortion <100.

###### Proof.

For each n\in\mathbb{N} consider the following n disjoint transpositions in Sym\_{4n^{2}}

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | t\_{1}:=(0,n),t\_{2}:=(1\;n+1),t\_{3}:=(2\;n+2),...,t\_{n}:=(n-1\;2n-1). |  |

Map each (\epsilon\_{1},...,\epsilon\_{n})\in\{0,1\}^{n} to the permutation
f\_{\epsilon}:=t\_{1}^{\epsilon\_{1}}...t\_{n}^{\epsilon\_{n}}.
  
Fix distinct \epsilon=(\epsilon\_{1},...,\epsilon\_{n}),\delta=(\delta\_{1},...,\delta\_{n})\in%
\{0,1\}^{n}.
By the word metric formula in Section 2, we have the upper bound:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d(f\_{\epsilon},f\_{\delta})\leq\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}\left(5\sum\_{k\in% \mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}(f\_{\epsilon}(k)-l,f\_{\delta}(k))+3diam% \_{\mathbb{Z}/n^{2}}(\{0,l\}\cup\{p:f\_{\epsilon}^{-1}(p)\neq f\_{\delta}^{-1}(p-% l)\})\right) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \leq 5\sum\_{k\in\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}(f\_{\epsilon}(k),f\_{% \delta}(k))+6n=5n||\epsilon-\delta||\_{1}+6n\leq 11n||\epsilon-\delta||\_{1}, |  |

and the lower bound:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d(f\_{\epsilon},f\_{\delta})\geq\dfrac{1}{3}\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}\sum\_{k% \in\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}(f\_{\epsilon}(k)-l,f\_{\delta}(k)) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | =\dfrac{1}{3}\min\_{l\in\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}\left((4n^{2}-2n)d\_{\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}% }(0,l)+\sum\_{i:\epsilon\_{i}=\delta\_{i}}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}(0,l)+\sum\_{% \epsilon\_{i}=0,\delta\_{i}=1}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}(n,l)+\sum\_{\epsilon\_{i}=1,% \delta\_{i}=0}d\_{\mathbb{Z}/4n^{2}}(-n,l)\right). |  |

By inspection, it is clear that the minimizer occurs at l=0 so we get

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dfrac{1}{3}n||\epsilon-\delta||\_{1}\leq d(f\_{\epsilon},f\_{\delta})\leq 11n||% \epsilon-\delta||\_{1}. |  |
