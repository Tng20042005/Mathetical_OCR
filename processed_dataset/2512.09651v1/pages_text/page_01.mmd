###### Abstract.

For C/\mathbb{Q}\_{p} a complete algebraically closed field, we construct a collection of non-isomorphic rank two \mathbb{Q}\_{p}-local systems on \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C} indexed by C. This implies that the de Jong fundamental group \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}) depends on C and, if C has cardinality >2^{\mathbb{N}}, that \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}) is not topologically countably generated. The argument in fact applies to any connected rigid analytic variety over C with a non-constant function to \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}.

Let C/\mathbb{Q}\_{p} be a complete algebraically closed extension and consider \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C} as a rigid analytic variety over C. For t\in C, we have a map \varphi\_{t}:\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},\;(t,[x:y])\mapsto%
[x^{2}:(x-ty)^{2}].
On the open subvariety \mathbb{A}^{1}\_{C}=\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}\backslash\{[1:0]\} with coordinate z=x/y, \varphi\_{t} is the map z\mapsto(z-t)^{2}.
Let \mathbb{L} be the Lubin-Tate rank two \mathbb{Q}\_{p}-local system on the rigid analytic variety \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C} described in [1, Proposition 7.2] and let \mathbb{L}\_{t}:=\varphi\_{t}^{\*}\mathbb{L}.

###### Lemma 1.

If t\_{1}\neq t\_{2}, then \mathbb{L}\_{t\_{1}} is not isomorphic to \mathbb{L}\_{t\_{2}}.

###### Proof.

Let \kappa:T\_{\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}}\rightarrow\mathcal{E}nd(\mathbb{L}\otimes{\hat{%
\mathcal{O}}})(-1) be the geometric Sen morphism associated to \mathbb{L}\otimes\hat{\mathcal{O}} by [3, Theorem 1.0.3]. From its computation in [2, §4.3], it follows that \kappa is injective at every geometric point of \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C} (cf. [Howe.ThedeJongFundamentalOfANonTrivialAbelianVarietyIsNonAbelian, Lemma 2]). Now, for t\in C, functoriality of the geometric Sen morphism [3, Theorem 1.0.3-(5)] implies that the geometric Sen morphism of \mathbb{L}\_{t} is \varphi\_{t}^{\*}\kappa\circ d\varphi\_{t}. In particular, writting \kappa\_{i} for the geometric Sen morphism of \mathbb{L}\_{t\_{i}}, we find \kappa\_{1} is zero on the fiber T\_{\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[t\_{1}:1]} whereas \kappa\_{2} is not (the derivative of z\mapsto(z-t)^{2} on \mathbb{A}^{1}\_{C} vanishes exactly at t). Thus \mathbb{L}\_{1}\not\cong\mathbb{L}\_{2}.

###### Theorem 1.

Let \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]) be the de Jong fundamental group of [1]. If S\subseteq\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]) is infinite and 2^{S} has cardinality less than C, then S is not a set of topological generators for \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]). In particular, if C has cardinality >2^{\mathbb{N}} then \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]) is not topologically countably generated.

###### Proof.

By 1, \{\mathbb{L}\_{t}\}\_{t\in C} is a collection of non-isomorphic rank two \mathbb{Q}\_{p}-local systems indexed by C. On the other hand, by [1, Theorem 4.2], the isomorphism classes of rank two local systems on \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C} are the same as isomorphism classes of continuous representations of \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]) on 2-dimensional \mathbb{Q}\_{p}-vector spaces. If S is a set of topological generators, then the cardinality of this latter set is bounded by the cardinality of the set \mathrm{GL}\_{2}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p})^{S}. Since \mathrm{GL}\_{2}(\mathbb{Q}\_{p}) has cardinality 2^{\mathbb{N}}, this is the same cardinality as (2^{\mathbb{N}})^{S}=2^{\mathbb{N}\times S}. Since we assume S is infinite, this is the same cardinality as 2^{S}, and thus we conclude.
∎

###### Corollary 1.

\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]) depends on the choice of C.

###### Proof.

For a fixed C, take C^{\prime} of cardinality larger than the power set of \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]). Then, 1 implies \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C^{\prime}},[1:0])\not\cong\pi\_{1,\mathrm{%
dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]) (since S=\pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0]) generates \pi\_{1,\mathrm{dJ}}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C},[1:0])).
∎

###### Remark 1.

Suppose Z/C is a connected reduced rigid analytic variety admitting a non-constant rational function, i.e. a non-constant map f:Z\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C} (e.g., Z could be quasi-projective). Let Z^{\mathrm{sm}} be the open dense smooth locus. By composing with an automorphism of \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}, we can assume there exists a point z\in Z^{\mathrm{sm}}(C) in the fiber of f over [0:1] such that df is surjective at z; by the implicit function theorem, the same then holds over any point in a sufficiently small ball B around [0:1] in \mathbb{P}^{1}(C). The local systems f^{\*}\mathbb{L}\_{t}, t\in B, are then pairwise non-isomorphic rank two \mathbb{Q}\_{p}-local systems on Z indexed by B — indeed, arguing as in the proof of 1 using the geometric Sen morphism of f^{\*}\mathbb{L}\_{t}|\_{Z^{\mathrm{sm}}}, one finds that there is a point in the fiber over s\in B where this geometric Sen morphism is non-zero exactly when s\neq t. Using this result in place of 1, we find the statements of Theorem 1 and 1 hold also for Z in place of \mathbb{P}^{1}\_{C}.
