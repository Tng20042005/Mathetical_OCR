###### Abstract

In the suborbital graphs studies, there has been a research gap in the sense that the Modular group is connected to two numbers. Thus, this paper attempts to contribute to the studies developed by Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky and Riemann. However, this study mainly concentrates on the action of suborbital graphs obtained with the Modular congruence subgroup \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right), making this study sui generis since it deals with the Modular group, connected to two numbers. In developing our graph action, we utilized the theories of non-Euclidean geometry. Investigating the congruence relation other than identity and universal relation, the number of congruence relation, transitive act on vertices and edges, edge condition for the congruence group \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right), based on previously-obtained studies, we concluded with new theorems in this study. So, the results are obtained in this paper related to a different congruence modular subgroup provides various aspects of the same structure in mathematics and adapting it to such as algebraic geometry, number theory, differential geometry, topology and physics.

## 1 Introduction

This paper analyzing the congruence relation other than identity and universal relation, the number of congruence relation, transitive act on vertices and edges, edge condition for the congruence group \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) consist of 4 sections. In the first section, relevant literature about suborbital graphs and modular group \Gamma is given. The second section gives the results related to obtained by act of the congruence group \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) on suborbital graphs F\_{u,L} and F\_{M,u}. In the third section, since \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma\_{0}\left(L\right) and \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma^{0}\left(M\right), it is highlighted that \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) generates different orbitals according to \infty and 0. The fourth section briefly gives the results obtained in this paper.
