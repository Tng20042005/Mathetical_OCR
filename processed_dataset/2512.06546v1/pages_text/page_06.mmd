The uniform response of these graphs to group actions makes them useful in areas of electrical and computer science, where they enable understanding of network structure, encoding and decoding, and cryptosystem design. In mechanical and structural science, invariance to transformation and modularity properties of these graphs finds practical application in the analysis of dynamic and periodic structures. More generally, structures mathematically defined by the action of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) provide an exact suite of principles that can be generalized to successfully model behaviors of real-system examples of discrete, symmetric, or hierarchical interactions.

The promise of interdisciplinary uses highlights the ability of theoretical mathematics to provide new insights into solving engineering problems, particularly in systems that benefit from greater accuracy, consistency, and stronger structural integrity.

Throughout the study, + demonstrates that \frac{r}{s} is greater than \frac{x}{y} and - demonstrates that \frac{x}{y} is greater than \frac{r}{s}. The proofs in the study are made for +. The proofs can however be reached in the same way for -.

### 2.1 Some Conclusions Obtained by \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) on F\_{u,L}

In this section, we aim at drawing some conclusions about the suborbital graphs for G=\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) and \Omega=\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}. Firstly, we have to indicate that \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) acts on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}} transitively. From [6], we have to find a maximal subgroup of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right), which \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) acts transitively on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}}.

\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) acts transitively on orbit \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1\\
L\end{array}\right). So, \left(\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right),\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}\right) has to be imprimitive permutative group. Then, there is a congruence relation different from identity and universal relations. Assume that two elements are g=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a\_{1}&b\_{1}\\
c\_{1}&d\_{1}\end{array}\right) and g^{{}^{\prime}}=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a\_{2}&b\_{2}\\
c\_{2}&d\_{2}\end{array}\right) in \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) for \Gamma\_{0,\infty}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma, where \Gamma\_{0,\infty}\left(L,M\right) is a stabilizer of \infty . From here, it can be presented as g\left(\infty\right)\approx g^{{}^{\prime}}\left(\infty\right)\Leftrightarrow%
\infty\approx g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}\left(\infty\right)\Leftrightarrow g^{-1}g^%
{{}^{\prime}}\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). That is,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}d\_{1}&-b\_{1}\\ -c\_{1}&a\_{1}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a\_{2}&b\_{2}\\ c\_{2}&d\_{2}\end{array}\right) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | =\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}d\_{1}a\_{2}-b\_{1}c\_{2}&d\_{1}b\_{2}-b\_{1}d\_{2}\\ -a\_{2}c\_{1}+a\_{1}c\_{2}&a\_{1}d\_{2}-c\_{1}b\_{2}\end{array}\right) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | =\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}d\_{1}a\_{2}&d\_{1}b\_{2}-b\_{1}d\_{2}\\ a\_{1}c\_{2}-a\_{2}c\_{1}&a\_{1}d\_{2}\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) |  |

for g^{-1}=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}d\_{1}&-b\_{1}\\
-c\_{1}&a\_{1}\end{array}\right), a\_{1}c\_{2}-a\_{2}c\_{1}\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right) and d\_{1}b\_{2}-b\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 0\left(\mod M\right). For \Gamma\_{0,\infty}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma, it is obtained d\_{1}a\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right) and a\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right). d\_{1}a\_{2}a\_{1}\equiv a\_{1}\left(\mod L\right) is obtained from d\_{1}a\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right). Since a\_{1}a\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right), d\_{1}\equiv a\_{1}\left(\mod L\right). Similarly, a\_{1}d\_{2}d\_{1}\equiv d\_{1}\left(\mod M\right) is found from a\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right). Then, a\_{1}\equiv d\_{1}\left(\mod M\right) for d\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right). So, g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) can be accepted.
