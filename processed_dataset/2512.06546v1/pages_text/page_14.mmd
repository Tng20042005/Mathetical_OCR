|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}-b&-x\left(1+aL\right)-by\\ -\left(1+dM\right)&-xc-y\left(1+dM\right)\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array% }[]{ccc}M&0\\ u&1\end{array}\right). |  |

From the equation of two matrices, -b=M and u=-\left(1+dM\right) are obtained. If these values are substituted in -xc-y\left(1+dM\right)=1, uy\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right) is found. In addition, ry-sx=M is achieved for the edge \frac{r}{s}\longrightarrow\frac{x}{y}. Similarly, ry-sx=-M is found for the edge \frac{x}{y}\longrightarrow\frac{r}{s}. However, the edge condition is presented as x\equiv ur\left(\mod M\right),y\equiv us\left(modM\right);ry-sx=M for an edge from \frac{r}{s} to \frac{x}{y} in Theorem 7. From here, \overline{u}x\equiv u\overline{u}r\left(\mod M\right) is obtained. If it is taken u\overline{u}\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right), \overline{u}x\equiv r\left(\mod M\right) is found. That is, r\equiv\overline{u}x\left(\mod M\right). Similarly, y\equiv us\left(\mod M\right) is given in Theorem 7. \overline{u}y\equiv u\overline{u}s\left(\mod M\right) is obtained. Then, \overline{u}y\equiv s\left(\mod M\right). So, s\equiv\overline{u}y\left(\mod M\right).

## 3 Conclusion

In this paper, the modular group \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) based on two numbers is presented and the suborbital graphs formed by the action of this modular group are analyzed. Since \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma\_{0}\left(L\right), \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) generates orbital starting with \infty. In addition, \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) generates orbital starting with 0 for \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma^{0}\left(M\right). It can be seen that congruence modular group \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) forms different orbitals according to \infty and 0. Here, it can be given \frac{u\_{2}-u\_{1}u\_{2}-u\_{1}}{M}\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right) for T^{0}\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) . Then, u\_{2}-u\_{1}u\_{2}-u\_{1}=kML is obtained. From here, \frac{u\_{2}-u\_{1}u\_{2}-u\_{1}}{M}\equiv 0\left(\mod M\right) is achieved. Similarly, results are obtained for T\_{0}\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right).
Thus, by studying a different congruence modular subgroup, this paper gives various aspects of the same structure from different perspectives in mathematics and adapts it to different fields such as algebraic geometry, number theory, differential geometry, topology, and physics.
