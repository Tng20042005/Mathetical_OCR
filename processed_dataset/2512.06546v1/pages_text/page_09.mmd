Assume that there is an edge from \frac{r}{s} to \frac{x}{y} in F\_{u,L}. We have to find an element of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right), transferring from \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1&u\\
0&L\end{array}\right) to \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&x\\
s&y\end{array}\right). Therefore, matrix T\_{0}=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1+aL&b\\
c&1+dM\end{array}\right) can be selected as an element of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). Thus, the transform is defined as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1+aL&b\\ c&1+dM\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1&u\\ 0&L\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&x\\ s&y\end{array}\right). |  |

At the same time, T\_{0}\left(\frac{1}{0}\right)=\frac{r}{s} and T\_{0}\left(\frac{u}{L}\right)=\frac{x}{y} is provided. Hence, r\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right) and s\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right) are reached. Moreover, the matrix multiplication

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1+aL&u(1+aL)+bL\\ c&uc+(1+dM)L\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&x\\ s&y\end{array}\right) |  |

is obtained. r=1+aL and s=c can be directly seen. Moreover,
x\equiv\mp ur\left(modL\right) is obtained for equation x=u\left(1+aL\right)+bL=ur+bL and y\equiv\mp us\left(modL\right) is obtained for equation y=uc+\left(1+dM\right)L=us+\left(1+dM\right)L. ry-sx=L can be easily seen.

By contrast, assume that r\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right), s\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right), x\equiv\mp ur\left(\mod L\right) and y\equiv\mp us\left(\mod L\right) are provided. We have to demonstrate that there is an edge. Hence, x=ur+aL is obtained from x\equiv\mp ur\left(\mod L\right) and y=us+cL is obtained from y\equiv\mp us\left(\mod L\right), for a,c\in\mathbb{Z}. Moreover, we can write the following equation:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&a\\ s&c\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1&u\\ 0&L\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&ur+aL\\ s&us+cL\end{array}\right) |  |

Since r\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right) and s\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right), c\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right) is obtained from rc-sa=1.
Consequently, \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&a\\
s&c\end{array}\right) is an element of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right).
∎

###### Theorem 5.

\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) transitively permutes the vertices and the edges on F\_{u,L}.

###### Proof.

At first, let us present that \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) permutes the vertices. Here, assume that the vertices \frac{u\_{1}}{L} and \frac{u\_{2}}{L} are on orbit \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1\\
0\end{array}\right) and \approx is an invariant equivalence relation. Due to transitive action, there is an T\_{0}\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) providing T\_{0}\left(\frac{u\_{1}}{L}\right)=\frac{u\_{2}}{L}. Then, T\_{0}\left(\frac{u\_{1}}{L}\right)\approx T\_{0}\left(\infty\right) is provided for \frac{u\_{1}}{L}\approx\infty. Moreover, \frac{u\_{2}}{L}\approx T\_{0}\left(\infty\right) is obtained.
