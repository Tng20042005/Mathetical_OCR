[4] Assume that T\left(N\right) is a multiplication function for \left(N\_{1},N\_{2}\right)=1. Thus, T\left(N\_{1}N\_{2}\right)=T\left(N\_{1}\right)T\left(N\_{2}\right).

###### Theorem 1.

[4] Assume that N\_{1} and N\_{2} are positive integers and \{N\_{1},N\_{2}\} is the least common multiple of these positive integers. Then,

\Gamma\left(N\_{1}\right)\cap\Gamma\left(N\_{2}\right)=\Gamma\left(\{N\_{1},N\_{2}%
\}\right)

\Gamma\left(N\_{1}\right)\Gamma\left(N\_{2}\right)=\Gamma\left(\left(N\_{1},N\_{2}%
\right)\right)

###### Theorem 2.

[4] Assume that N\_{1} and N\_{2} are positive integers. So,

\Gamma\left(N\_{1}\right)\Gamma^{0}\left(N\_{2}\right)=\Gamma^{0}\left(\left(N\_{%
1},N\_{2}\right)\right)

\Gamma\left(N\_{1}\right)\Gamma\_{0}\left(N\_{2}\right)=\Gamma\_{0}\left(\left(N\_{%
1},N\_{2}\right)\right).

These notations presented in [4] have not been confused with the notations of the present study, as the presumptions of these studies are different.

However, the authors studied the action of \Gamma\_{0}\left(p\right) on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}} in which p is a prime number in [5]. In this article, they used orbit

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a\\ b\end{array}\right)=\left\{\frac{x}{y}\in\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}:(p,y)=b,x\equiv a% \mod\left(b,\frac{p}{b}\right)\right\}. |  |

Since the action on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}} is transitive, they utilized the orbit

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1\\ p\end{array}\right)=\left\{\frac{x}{y}\in\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}:(p,y)=b\right\} |  |

that contains \infty.

In [6], the authors examined the action of \Gamma^{0}\left(p\right) and they presented the edge conditions for p prime numbers. Here, they discussed the orbit

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a\\ b\end{array}\right)=\left\{\frac{x}{y}\in\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}:(p,y)=b,x\equiv a% \mod(b,\frac{p}{b})\right\}. |  |

They also demonstrated that the action of \Gamma^{0}\left(p\right) is not transitive, presenting the group:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma^{\*}(p)=\left\{\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1+ap&bp\\ c&1+dp\end{array}\right)\mid bp\equiv 0\left(\mod p\right)\right\} |  |

The group \Gamma^{\*}(p) is provided order \Gamma^{0}<\Gamma^{\*}(p)<\Gamma^{0}(p). Furthermore, the orbit

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1\\ p\end{array}\right)=\left\{\frac{x}{y}\in\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}:(p,y)=b\right\} |  |

that contains 0 is chosen to make the act transitive. In addition, they indicated that \Gamma^{0}\left(N\right) acts imprimitively on the orbit \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1\\
p\end{array}\right). Furthermore, the authors investigated the suborbital graphs obtained by \Gamma^{0}\left(N\right). Since all the blocs acquired by \Gamma^{0}\left(N\right) are isomorphic, they use only block \left[0\right]. Hence, they presented edge conditions for suborbital graphs F\_{p,q} as follows:

There is an edge from vertex \frac{r}{s} to vertex \frac{x}{y} if and only if x\equiv\mp pr\left(\mod q\right),r\equiv 0\left(\mod q\right) or y\equiv\mp ps\left(\mod q\right),s\equiv 1\left(\mod q\right);ry-sx=\mp q.
