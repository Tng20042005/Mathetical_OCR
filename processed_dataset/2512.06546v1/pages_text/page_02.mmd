Euclid’s Elements has been translated into many different languages and studied for centuries. The possibility of situations where the 5th postulate in Euclid?s Elements did not hold took mathematical thinking forward and led to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries. For this reason,the 19th century was a milestone for mathematics. Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Bernhard Riemann studied non-Euclidean geometries. The perspective of mathematics, a joint product of many mathematicians, was broadened in the 19th century as a result of the studies on non-Euclidean geometries by the mathematician Bernhard Riemann. Elliptic and Hyperbolic Geometries are examples of non-Euclidean geometries. In previous years, many topics that had been part of mathematics began to be studied in these geometries. Graph theory is an example of these topics. By transferring Graph theory to Elliptic and Hyperbolic geometries, studies of these fields were initiated. In the 19th century, Henry Poincare presented some results for the theory of discrete groups, and the results gave rise to the generalization of the theory of elliptic functions. Invariant theory led to further studies on linear fractional congruence groups. In [1], some ideas have been put forward about graph action. These ideas can be summarized as follows:

Assume that \left(G,\Omega\right) is a transitive permutation group. So, G acts on \Omega\times\Omega with transform g:\left(\alpha,\beta\right)\rightarrow\left(g\left(\alpha\right),g\left(\beta%
\right)\right), where g\in G and \alpha,\beta\in\Omega. The orbitals of this action is called the suborbitals of G. The orbital that contains \left(\alpha,\beta\right) is demonstrated with O\left(\alpha,\beta\right) and suborbital graph G\left(\alpha,\beta\right), which is the constitute of suborbital O\left(\alpha,\beta\right). In this suborbital graph, the vertices are considered as the elements on \Omega and the edge is a directed path which goes from vertex \gamma to vertex \delta. In addition, O\left(\beta,\alpha\right) is an orbital, too. O(\beta,\alpha) is equal to O\left(\alpha,\beta\right) or it is not. If it is equal, it is G\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=G\left(\beta,\alpha\right) and this suborbital graph has pair directed edges. If it is not, G\left(\alpha,\beta\right) has inversed directed edges, according to G\left(\beta,\alpha\right).

G acts on \Omega transitively. ”\approx” is called as the congruence relation on \Omega whenever g\left(\alpha\right)\approx g\left(\beta\right) for \alpha\approx\beta, where g\in G and \alpha,\beta\in\Omega. This congruence relation is called G-invariant congruence relation. It is called blocks for the congruence classes of this relation. There are always two congruence relations on \Omega. These are identity and universal congruence relations. Identity congruence relation can be demonstrated with \alpha\approx\beta\Rightarrow\alpha=\beta and universal congruence relation can be demonstrated \alpha\approx\beta, for \alpha,\beta\in\Omega. If there is a congruence relation different from identity and universal congruence relations, the action of G on \Omega is called imprimitive, if there is not, we name it primitive. The imprimitive action has to be transitive.

In [2], the authors proved that \left(G,\Omega\right) is an primitive permutation group provided that G\_{\alpha} is the stabilizer of vertex \alpha\in\Omega which is a maximal subgroup of G for \forall\alpha\in\Omega. Furthermore, \left(G,\Omega\right) is an imprimitive permutation group on the condition that there is a subgroup H of G providing G\_{\alpha}\lneqq H\lvertneqq G.

Modular group and its subgroups, which play an important role in Fermat’s last theorem, are extensively studied in the field of Graph theory. Hyperbolic geometry, one of non-Euclidean geometries, is the focus of this study. In this geometry, the upper plane \mathbb{H} is demonstrated with set \{z\in\mathbb{C}:Imz>0\}.If Modular group is demonstrated with \Gamma, it is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma=PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})\cong SL(2,\mathbb{Z})/\{\mp I\}. |  |

Modular group \Gamma is given as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma=\left\{\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\mid a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z},ad-bc=1\right\} |  | (1) |

The elements of Modular group \Gamma are formulated with Möbius transforms. That is

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | T\left(z\right)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d},T\in\Gamma. |  | (2) |

In addition to this, there are numerous congruence subgroups of the modular group \Gamma. Some of these can be listed as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma\_{1}\left(N\right)=\left\{\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\mid a\equiv d\equiv 1\left(modN\right),b\equiv c% \equiv 0\left(modN\right)\right\} |  | (3) |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma\_{0}(N)=\left\{\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\mid c\equiv 0\left(modN\right)\right\} |  | (4) |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma^{0}(N)=\left\{\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\mid b\equiv 0\left(modN\right)\right\} |  | (5) |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma\_{0}^{0}\left(N\right)=\left\{\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\mid b\equiv c\equiv 0\left(modN\right)\right\} |  | (6) |
