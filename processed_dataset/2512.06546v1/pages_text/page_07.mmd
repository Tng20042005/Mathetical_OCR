In addition, if \frac{x}{y} is reduced on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}}, the representation, under \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right), is also reduced. So,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\frac{x}{y}=\frac{ax+by}{cx+dy} |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | c\left(ax+by\right)-a\left(cx+dy\right)=cax+cby-acx-ady=\left(cb-ad\right)y=-y |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d\left(ax+by\right)-b\left(cx+dy\right)=dax+dby-bcx-bdy=x\left(da-bc\right)=x. |  |

Then, \left(ax+by,cx+dy\right)=1.

###### Theorem 3.

Assume that p\_{i} are prime factors for L, r is a multiplier other than prime numbers and q\_{j} are prime factors for M, s is a multiplier other than prime numbers in which i=1,2,\cdots,n, j=1,2,\cdots,m.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi\left(L,M\right)=r\prod\_{i=1}^{n}\left(p\_{i}+1\right)+s\prod\_{j=1}^{m}% \left(q\_{j}+1\right) |  |

###### Proof.

In \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right), there are two invariant congruence relations. Because, \Gamma\_{0}, which is stabilizer of 0 and \Gamma\_{\infty} are subgroups of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). So, we have to obtain values both L and M.

For L with given above,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi\left(L\right)=L\prod\_{p\_{i}/L}\left(1+\frac{1}{p\_{i}}\right). |  |

Similarly in [2, Lemma 2.2.], we have to demonstrate every two sides of equation to be multiplicative functions. Assume that L=\omega\_{1}\omega\_{2}, for \left(\omega\_{1},\omega\_{2}\right)=1. From the invariant congruence relation \approx\_{L}, v\_{L}\approx\_{L}w\_{L}\Leftrightarrow v\_{L}\approx\_{\omega\_{1}}w\_{L} and v\_{L}\approx\_{\omega\_{2}}w\_{L}. On the other hand, it can be written L=rp\_{1}p\_{2}\cdots p\_{n}. So, L is obtained as multiplier of p prime numbers.

If it is taken as v=\frac{a\_{1}}{c\_{1}}, one of the a\_{1} and c\_{1} is relatively prime with p\_{i} numbers. Then,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi\left(L\right)=rp\_{1}p\_{2}\cdots p\_{n}\left(1+\frac{1}{p\_{1}}\right)% \left(1+\frac{1}{p\_{2}}\right)\cdots\left(1+\frac{1}{p\_{n}}\right) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | =rp\_{1}p\_{2}\cdots p\_{n}\left(\frac{1+p\_{1}}{p\_{1}}\right)\left(\frac{1+p\_{2}}% {p\_{2}}\right)\cdots\left(\frac{1+p\_{n}}{p\_{n}}\right) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | =r\left(1+p\_{1}\right)\left(1+p\_{2}\right)\cdots\left(1+p\_{n}\right) |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | =r\prod\_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+p\_{i}\right) |  |

Similar operations can be made for M. Hence, it is found

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi\left(M\right)=s\prod\_{j=1}^{m}\left(1+q\_{j}\right). |  |

Since \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) has two invariant congruence relation, the number of invariant congruence relation is the sum of \varphi\left(L\right) and \varphi\left(M\right). Consequently,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi\left(L,M\right)=r\prod\_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+p\_{i}\right)+s\prod\_{j=1}^{m}% \left(1+q\_{j}\right). |  |

∎

At the moment, we will present a corollary about the transitive action obtained by \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}}.
