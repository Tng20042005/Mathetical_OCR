Also, the action of \Gamma^{0}\left(N\right) and edge conditions on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}}, G\_{p,q} and F\_{p,q} are explored in [7]. In this paper, the orbit

is investigated in which N is a natural number. Moreover, the authors presented the set of orbits \Gamma^{0}\left(N\right) and expressed that \left(\Gamma^{0}\left(N\right),\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1\\
1\end{array}\right)\right) is a transitive permutation group. Here, the edge conditions are provided as follows:

There is an edge from vertex \frac{r}{s} to vertex \frac{x}{y} if and only if x\equiv\mp pr\left(\mod Nq\right),r\equiv 0\left(\mod q\right) or y\equiv\mp ps\left(\mod q\right),s\equiv 1\left(\mod q\right);ry-sx=\mp q.

In [8], the relation has been investigated between suborbital graphs and continued fractions, and a vertex of a suborbital graph has been denoted as a continued fraction. In [9], the vertices obtained as a continued fraction have been expressed with Fibonacci numbers, and the vertices obtained have been generalized. Also, the author defined minimal length between vertices and presented a relevant theorem for minimal length in [10]. In [11], the author has worked on defining the Modular group and its congruence subgroups, which have been widely discussed. The suborbital graphs were studied for the Atkin-Lehner group in [12].

The aim of this article is to seek for an answer to given as a proposition in [13]. In this article, with the help of the information presented above, the congruence relation other than identity and universal relation, transitive act on vertices and edges, edge condition are represented about that are the congruence subgroups of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). The congruence subgroups of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) and \Gamma\_{0}^{0}\left(L,M\right) can be presented in which L and M are integers as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)=\Bigg{\{}\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\mid a\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right),d\equiv 1\left% (\mod M\right),\\ c\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right),b\equiv 0\left(\mod M\right)\Bigg{\}} |  | (7) |

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Gamma\_{0}^{0}\left(L,M\right)=\left\{\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\mid c\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right),b\equiv 0\left% (\mod M\right)\right\} |  | (8) |

Even though they are presented through exact theoretical mathematics, such as modular groups and suborbital graph theory, conclusions of this research have strong practical applicability to numerous areas of engineering. The properties of suborbital graphs such as symmetry, transitivity, and edge qualities as determined by congruence subgroups directly relate to the fundamental principles of building effective, robust, and modular engineering systems.
