The congruence subgroups given in Equations (3)-(6) have intensely been studied in recent years. Especially, Equation (4) has been studied in [2, 3, 4, 5] and Equation (5) has been studied in [6, 7].

Based on these ideas, it has been studied the Modular groups in case of G=\Gamma and \Omega=\widehat{\mathbb{Q}} in [2]. In addition to, \Gamma\_{\infty} ,which is stabilizer of \infty, is a subgroup of \Gamma generated by matrix \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1&1\\
0&1\end{array}\right). Then, the invariant congruence equations \Gamma on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}} could be obtained should be there is a subgroup U of \Gamma, which contains \Gamma\_{\infty} or equally \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1&1\\
0&1\end{array}\right). So, subgroup U can be accepted as \Gamma\_{0}(N). In other words, \Gamma\_{\infty}<\Gamma\_{0}(N)\leq\Gamma for N\in\mathbb{N} and \Gamma\_{\infty}<\Gamma\_{0}(N)<\Gamma. Therefore, \Gamma acts imprimitively on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}}.

Assume that invariant congruence equation is \approx\_{N}. Then, g\left(\infty\right)\approx\_{N}g^{{}^{\prime}}\left(\infty\right)%
\Leftrightarrow\infty\approx\_{N}g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}\left(\infty\right)%
\Leftrightarrow g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}\in U=\Gamma\_{0}\left(N\right) in which g=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&\*\\
s&\*\end{array}\right),g^{{}^{\prime}}=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}x&\*\\
y&\*\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma and v=\frac{r}{s},w=\frac{x}{y}\in\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}. That is, v\approx\_{N}w\Leftrightarrow g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(N\right).

|  | g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}\*&-s\\ &r\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}x&\*\\ y&\*\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}\*&\*\\ ry-sx&\*\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(N\right). |  |

Consequently, v\approx\_{N}w\Leftrightarrow ry-sx\equiv 0\left(modN\right) can be found. So, x\equiv ur\left(modN\right) and y\equiv us\left(modN\right) can be obtained for u\in N. From here, the number of invariant congruence equation is given as follows

|  | \varphi\left(N\right)=N\prod\_{p/N}\left(1+\frac{1}{p}\right) |  |

for p prime numbers in [2].

However, they investigated the suborbital graphs G\_{u,N} and F\_{u,N}, which obtained an element of the Modular group \Gamma, for \left(u,N\right)=1 and u<N. Also, they provided edge conditions for G\_{u,N} and F\_{u,N}. Edge conditions for F\_{u,N} and G\_{u,N} are presented in [2], where \frac{r}{s} and \frac{x}{y} are vertices on F\_{u,N} and G\_{u,N}:
  
There is an edge from vertex \frac{r}{s} to vertex \frac{x}{y} provided that if x\equiv\mp ur\left(modN\right) or y\equiv\mp us\left(modN\right); ry-sx=\mp N.
In addition, the state of being a forest in the graph has been given as a conjecture. The conjecture has been solved in [3].
  
In [4], author studied Modular groups and its subgroups comprehensively. Moreover, the author presented some conclusions that we also used in this article.
