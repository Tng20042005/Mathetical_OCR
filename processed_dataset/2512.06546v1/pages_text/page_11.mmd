Inversely, assume that u^{2}\equiv\mp 1\left(\mod L\right), where F\_{u,L} is a suborbital graph starting with \infty. Then, u^{2}=1+b\_{1}L and u^{2}=-1+b\_{2}L are obtained. For u^{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right), it can be written from determination,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}u&b\_{1}\\ L&u\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). |  |

Similarly, for u^{2}\equiv-1\left(\mod L\right),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}u&b\_{2}\\ L&-u\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). |  |

### 2.2 Some Conclusions Obtained by \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) on F\_{M,u}

Here, we want to achieve some conclusions obtained by \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) and \widehat{\mathbb{Q}}. Also, the transitive action of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) on \widehat{\mathbb{Q}} can easily be demonstrated. To this end, we have to obtain a maximal subgroup from [6]. Moreover, \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) can be selected as maximal subgroup for
\Gamma^{0,0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma where \Gamma^{0,0}\left(L,M\right) is a subgroup of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) that stabilizer of 0.

Since \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) acts transitively on orbit \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}M\\
1\end{array}\right), \left(\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right),\widehat{\mathbb{Q}}\right) is an imprimitive permutation group. Unlike the identity and universal, we have to prove that there is a congruence relation.

Assume that two elements are g=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a\_{1}&b\_{1}\\
c\_{1}&d\_{1}\end{array}\right) and g^{{}^{\prime}}=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a\_{2}&b\_{2}\\
c\_{2}&d\_{2}\end{array}\right) in \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right), which is similar to the information presented above. So, g\left(0\right)\approx g^{{}^{\prime}}\left(0\right)\Leftrightarrow 0\approx g%
^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}\left(0\right)\Leftrightarrow g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}\in%
\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). Hence,
a\_{1}c\_{2}-a\_{2}c\_{1}\equiv 0\left(\mod L\right) and d\_{1}b\_{2}-b\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 0\left(\mod M\right). Also, d\_{1}a\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right) and a\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right) are found, taking \Gamma^{0,0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right)<\Gamma,into account. In addition, d\_{1}a\_{2}a\_{1}\equiv a\_{1}\left(\mod L\right) is achieved. As a result of this, d\_{1}\equiv a\_{1}\left(\mod L\right) is reached for a\_{1}a\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right). Similarly, a\_{1}d\_{2}d\_{1}\equiv d\_{1}\left(\mod M\right) is obtained from a\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right). Taking d\_{1}d\_{2}\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right) into consideration, a\_{1}\equiv d\_{1}\left(\mod M\right) is reached. So, g^{-1}g^{{}^{\prime}}=T^{0} is accepted as \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1+aL&b\\
c&1+dM\end{array}\right).

###### Theorem 7.

Assume that \frac{r}{s} and \frac{x}{y} are vertices on F\_{M,u}. There should be an edge from \frac{r}{s} to \frac{x}{y} provided that x\equiv\mp ur\left(\mod M\right),y\equiv\mp us\left(\mod M\right);ry-sx=M.
