Firstly, assume that \frac{r}{s} and \frac{x}{y} are vertices on F\_{M,u} and there is an edge from \frac{r}{s} to \frac{x}{y}. Then, we must obtain an element in \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). So, T^{0} can be used here as an element of \Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right). Moreover, T^{0} sends \frac{0}{1} to \frac{r}{s} and \frac{M}{u} to \frac{x}{y}. Here, it is clear that r\equiv 0\left(\mod M\right) and s\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right). Furthermore,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1+aL&b\\ c&1+dM\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}0&M\\ 1&u\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&x\\ s&y\end{array}\right), |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}b&M(1+aL)+bu\\ 1+dM&cM+u(1+dM)\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&x\\ s&y\end{array}\right). |  |

From the equality of these two matrices, r=b and s=1+dM are obtained. In addition, from these equations, x=M\left(1+aL\right)+ru and y=cM+us are found. So, x\equiv\mp ur\left(\mod M\right) and y\equiv\mp us\left(\mod M\right) are reached. However, ry-sx=-M can clearly be seen from \det T^{0}=1.

On the other hand, assume that x\equiv\mp ur\left(\mod M\right),y\equiv\mp us\left(\mod M\right) ;ry-sx=M. Here, we have to achieve the element of Modular group providing an edge from \frac{r}{s} to \frac{x}{y}. From the orbit [0], r\equiv 0\left(\mod M\right) and s\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right) are found. From x\equiv\mp ur\left(\mod M\right) and y\equiv\mp us\left(\mod M\right), there are a and c in \mathbb{Z} providing x=ur+aM and y=us+cM. Then, ry-sx=M is obtained from x and y. Moreover,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&r\\ c&s\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}0&M\\ 1&u\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}r&ur+aM\\ s&us+cM\end{array}\right). |  |

From the equation as-rc=1, the congruence as-rc\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right) is obtained. From r\equiv 0\left(\mod M\right) and s\equiv 1\left(\mod M\right), a\equiv 1\left(\mod L\right) is reached. Consequently, \det\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&r\\
c&s\end{array}\right)=1. That is, \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&r\\
c&s\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right).
∎

###### Theorem 8.

\Gamma\_{0}\left(L,M\right) transitively permutes the vertices and the edges of F\_{M,u}.

###### Proof.

Initially, we will provide a proof related to the vertices. Assume that \frac{M}{u\_{1}},\frac{M}{u\_{2}} and \frac{M}{v\_{1}},\frac{M}{v\_{2}} are consecutive vertices and \frac{M}{u\_{1}}\rightarrow\frac{M}{u\_{2}} and \frac{M}{v\_{1}}\rightarrow\frac{M}{v\_{2}} are edges in F\_{M,u}. Thus, we have to indicate that there is an element of a set that provides a certain proof. If T^{0} is taken as \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\
c&d\end{array}\right),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}a&b\\ c&d\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}M\\ u\_{1}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}M\\ u\_{2}\end{array}\right) |  |

can be written. So, aM+bu\_{1}=M and cM+du\_{1}=u\_{2} are found. If these equations are solved, taking \left(M,u\_{1}\right)=1 into account, b=M and u\_{1}=1-a for bu\_{1}=M\left(1-a\right). Also, they can be found as a=1-u\_{1},b=M,c=\frac{u\_{2}-u\_{1}u\_{2}-u\_{1}}{M} and d=u\_{2}+1 for \left(M,u\_{2}\right)=1. Then, the relevant matrix can be written as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\begin{array}[]{ccc}1-u\_{1}&M\\ \frac{u\_{2}-u\_{1}u\_{2}-u\_{1}}{M}&u\_{2}+1\end{array}\right). |  |
