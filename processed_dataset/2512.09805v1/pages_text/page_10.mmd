Note that, formally, we have d(d^{p}z\_{j})=d^{p+1}z\_{j} for the local coordinates (z\_{1},\dots,z\_{n}).

\bullet Logarithmic Jet bundle. In the logarithmic setting, let D\subset X be a normal crossing divisor on X. Recall that D\subset X is of normal crossing
if, at each x\in X, there exist some local coordinates z\_{1},...,z\_{r},z\_{r+1},...,z\_{n} centered at x such that D is locally defined by

|  | D=\{z\_{1}\cdots z\_{r}=0\}. |  |

A holomorphic section s\in H^{0}(U,J\_{k}(X)) over an open subset U\subset X is said to be a  *logarithmic k-jet field* if  \tilde{\omega}\circ s are holomorphic for all sections \omega\in H^{0}(U^{\prime},T\_{X}^{\*}(\log D)), for all open subsets U^{\prime}\subset U, where \tilde{\omega} are induced maps defined as in [13]. Such logarithmic k-jet fields define a
subsheaf of J\_{k}(X), and this subsheaf is itself a sheaf of sections of a holomorphic fiber bundle over X, called the *logarithmic k-jet bundle over X along D*, denoted by J\_{k}(X,-\log D).

The group \mathbb{C}^{\*} acts fiberwise on the jet bundle as follows. For local coordinates

|  | z\_{1},\dots,z\_{\ell},z\_{\ell+1},\dots,z\_{n}\quad{(\ell=\ell(x))} |  |

centered at x in which D=\{z\_{1}\dots z\_{\ell}=0\}, for any logarithmic k-jet field along D represented by some germ f=(f\_{1},\dots,f\_{n}), if \varphi\_{\lambda}(z)=\lambda z is the homothety with ratio \lambda\in\mathbb{C}^{\*}, the action is given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \begin{cases}\big{(}\log(f\_{i}\circ\varphi\_{\lambda})\big{)}^{(j)}=\lambda^{j}% \big{(}\log f\_{i}\big{)}^{(j)}\circ\varphi\_{\lambda}&\quad{(1\,\leq\,i\,\leq\,% \ell),}\\ \big{(}f\_{i}\circ\varphi\_{\lambda}\big{)}^{(j)}\quad\quad\,=\lambda^{j}f\_{i}^{% (j)}\circ\varphi\_{\lambda}&\quad{(\ell+1\,\leq\,i\,\leq\,n).}\end{cases} |  |

\bullet Logarithmic Jet differential. A *logarithmic jet differential* of order k and degree m at a point x\in X
is a polynomial Q(f^{(1)},\dots,f^{(k)}) on the fiber over x of
J\_{k}(X,-\log D) enjoying weighted homogeneity:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Q\big{(}j\_{k}(f\circ\varphi\_{\lambda})\big{)}=\lambda^{m}Q\big{(}j\_{k}(f)\big{% )}. |  |

Denote by E\_{k,m}^{GG}T\_{X}^{\*}(\log D)\_{x} the vector space of such polynomials and set

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E\_{k,m}^{GG}T\_{X}^{\*}(\log D):=\bigcup\_{x\in X}E\_{k,m}^{GG}T\_{X}^{\*}(\log D)\_{% x}. |  |

By Faà di Bruno’s formula [12],
E\_{k,m}^{GG}T\_{X}^{\*}(\log D) carries the structure of a vector bundle over X,
called the *logarithmic Green–Griffiths vector bundle*.

A global section \mathcal{P} of E\_{k,m}^{GG}T\_{X}^{\*}(\log D) locally is of the following type in any local coordinates (z\_{1},\ldots,z\_{n}) on U with
D\cap U=\{z\_{1}\cdots z\_{r}=0\},
