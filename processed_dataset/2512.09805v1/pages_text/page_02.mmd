Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension n.
Let D be a normal crossing divisor on X and A be an ample line bundle on X. Let

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{P}\in H^{0}(X,E^{GG}\_{k,m}(T\_{X}^{\*}(\log D))\otimes A^{-\tilde{m}}). |  |

Let f:{\mathbb{C}}^{p}\rightarrow X be a meromorphic map with f({\mathbb{C}}^{p})\not\subset\text{Supp}(D). Assume that {\mathcal{P}}\big{(}j\_{k}(f\_{\vec{a}})\big{)}\not\equiv 0 for some \vec{a}\in S\_{p}(1). Then,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \tilde{m}T\_{f}(r,A)\leq mN^{(1)}\_{f}(r,D)+S\_{f}(r,A). |  |

To apply Theorem 1.3 in the case X=\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}), where
D is a generic hypersurface of sufficiently high degree d and
A=\mathcal{O}(1), following Siu’s strategy (see [22], [23]), we combine the existence
theorem for logarithmic jet differentials on \mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}) vanishing on an ample divisor with the technique of slanted vector fields.

More precisely, let S:=\mathbb{P}H^{0}\!\left(\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}),\mathcal{O}(d)\right) be the projective parameter space of homogeneous polynomials of degree d in \mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}) and let s\in S be the point corresponding to the above hypersurface D. We view X=\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}) as the fiber
\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C})\times\{s\}\subset\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C})\times S. Let \mathcal{P}\_{s} be a fixed nonzero logarithmic jet differential
on \mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C})\times\{s\}.
By the semi-continuity theorem ([9], Theorem 12.8), it extends
to a holomorphic family \mathcal{P} of nonzero logarithmic jet
differentials parametrized by points of a Zariski open neighborhood
U\_{s} of s in S.
Applying slanted vector fields with low pole order to this holomorphic family then produces new
jet differentials satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3. This leads to the following Second Main Theorem for
meromorphic maps into projective space intersecting a generic hypersurface
of sufficiently high degree (for details, see [23], [11], [21]).

###### Theorem 1.4.

Let D\subset\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}) be a generic hypersurface having degree

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | d\geq 15(5n+1)n^{n}. |  |

Let f:\mathbb{C}^{p}\to\mathbb{P}^{n}(\mathbb{C}) be a meromorphic map.
Assume that f has the Zariski dense image. Then the following estimate holds:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T\_{f}(r)\leq N\_{f}^{(1)}(r,D)+S\_{f}(r). |  |

Note that in the above theorem, f is assumed to be algebraically non-degenerate (i.e. f has the Zariski dense image).
However, according to Riedl and Yang [17], to derive the hyperbolicity of the complement of generic hypersurfaces in {\mathbb{P}}^{n}(\mathbb{C}), it can be reduced to studying
the algebraic degeneracy of the image of f. For the progress on the hyperbolicity of the complement of generic hypersurfaces in {\mathbb{P}}^{n}(\mathbb{C}), see [23], [1], [2], and [21].

## 2. Notations and preparations

We recall some notations and definitions. For references, see [19] and [20]. Let p\geq 1 be an integer.
For z=(z\_{1},\ldots,z\_{p})\in\mathbb{C}^{p}, we define
|z|=\bigl{(}|z\_{1}|^{2}+\cdots+|z\_{p}|^{2}\bigr{)}^{1/2}.
We denote by
B\_{p}(r)=\{z\in\mathbb{C}^{p}\mid|z|<r\}
the open ball in \mathbb{C}^{p} of radius r centered at the origin, and
S\_{p}(r)=\{z\in\mathbb{C}^{p}\mid|z|=r\}
the boundary of B\_{p}(r). Let \iota:S\_{p}(r)\hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}^{p} be the natural inclusion.
Then the pull-back of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sigma\_{p}=d^{c}\log|z|^{2}\wedge(dd^{c}\log|z|^{2})^{p-1} |  |
