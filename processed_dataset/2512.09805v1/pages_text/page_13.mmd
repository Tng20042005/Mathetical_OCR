We follow the arguments of the proof of Theorem 6.4.1 in [13]. We may assume from the beginning that

1. (i)

   A is a semi-abelian variety admitting an algebraic presentation

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | 0\longrightarrow(\mathbb{C}^{\ast})^{p}\longrightarrow A\longrightarrow A\_{0}% \longrightarrow 0, |  |

   and \overline{A} is a smooth projective equivariant compactification of A;
2. (ii)

   \operatorname{St}(D)^{0}=\{0\};
3. (iii)

   the closure \overline{D} is big on \overline{A} and is in good position.

Since \partial A is of normal crossing, consider the logarithmic k-th jet bundle

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A) |  |

over \overline{A} along \partial A, and a morphism

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \psi\_{k}:J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A)\to J\_{k}(\overline{A}). |  |

Because of the flat structure of the logarithmic tangent bundle T(\overline{A};\log\partial A),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A)\;\cong\;\overline{A}\times\mathbb{C}^{nk}. |  |

Let

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \pi\_{1}:J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A)\cong\overline{A}\times\mathbb{C}^{% nk}\;\to\;\overline{A},\qquad\pi\_{2}:J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A)\cong% \overline{A}\times\mathbb{C}^{nk}\;\to\;\mathbb{C}^{nk} |  |

be the first and second projections.
For a k-jet y\in J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A) we call \pi\_{2}(y) the *jet part* of y.
We define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | J\_{k}(\overline{D};\log\partial A)=\psi\_{k}^{-1}\big{(}J\_{k}(\overline{D})\big% {)}. |  |

Note that J\_{k}(\overline{D};\log\partial A) is a subspace of J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A), which depends in general on the embedding \overline{D}\hookrightarrow\overline{A} (cf. Sect. 4.6.3 in [13]). We also note that \pi\_{2}(J\_{k}(\overline{D};\log\partial A)) is an algebraic subset of \mathbb{C}^{nk}, because \pi\_{2} is proper.

Without loss of generality, we assume f(0)=0. Since f is non-degenerate, \overline{f(\mathbb{C}^{p})}^{\,Zar}=A.
By the proof of Bloch’s theorem above, we have
\overline{f\_{\vec{a}}(\mathbb{C})}^{\,Zar}=A,\text{ for almost every }\vec{a}%
\in S\_{p}(1).
That is, f\_{\vec{a}}:\mathbb{C}\to A is algebraically non-degenerate for almost every \vec{a}\in S\_{p}(1).

Fix an \vec{a}\_{0}\in S\_{p}(1)\setminus\bigcup\_{i=1}^{\infty}K\_{i}, and
let

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j\_{k}(f\_{\vec{a}\_{0}}):\mathbb{C}\to J\_{k}(\overline{A};\log\partial A)\;\cong% \;\overline{A}\times\mathbb{C}^{nk} |  |
