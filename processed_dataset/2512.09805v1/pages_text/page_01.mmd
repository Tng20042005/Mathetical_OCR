###### Abstract.

In [25], W. Stoll proposed a method of studying holomorphic functions of several complex variables by reducing them to one variable through fiber integration.
In this paper, we use this method to extend some important Nevanlinna-type results for holomorphic curves into projective varieties to meromorphic maps from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} to projective varieties.
This includes Bloch’s theorem and Noguchi-Winklemann-Yamanoi’s Second Main Theorem for holomorphic maps into semi-abelian varieties intersecting an effective divisor, as well as
Huynh-Vu-Xie’s Second Main Theorem for meromorphic maps into projective space intersecting with a generic hypersurface with sufficiently high degree.

## 1. Introduction

Recently, there have been several works in the study of meromorphic maps from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} to projective varieties, where p\geq 1 is an integer.
Notably, A. Etesse [8] developed the theory of the Green-Griffiths jet differentials of p-germs, Q. Cai, M. Ru, and C. J. Yang [4] used the result of Etesse to establish several defect relations for meromorphic maps from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} to projective varieties. See also [16], and for earlier results, [10].
In this paper, we study meromorphic maps from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} into projective varieties by reducing the p-variables to one variable through fiber integration, following the method of W. Stoll [25].

We first focus on the meromorphic maps from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} into semi-abelian varieties. The key result we used is the
following (see Corollary 5.1.9 in [13]): A semi-torus A contains only countably many sub-semi-tori.
We also note that every meromorphic map from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} into a semi-abelian variety is indeed holomorphic. Therefore, we only state the results for holomorphic maps from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} into semi-abelian varieties.

Our first result is to establish Bloch’s theorem for several complex variables.

###### Theorem 1.1 (Bloch’s theorem for several variables).

Let A be a semi-abelian variety and let
f:\mathbb{C}^{p}\to A be a holomorphic map.
Then the Zariski closure of f(\mathbb{C}^{p}) is a translate of a semi-abelian subvariety of A.

Next we extend the result of Noguchi-Winklemann-Yamanoi’s Second Main Theorem (see Theorem 6.4.1 in [13] or [14]; see also [15])
to the case of several complex variables.

###### Theorem 1.2.

Let A be a semi-torus with equivariant compactification \overline{A}.
Let f:\,\mathbb{C}^{p}\to A be a holomorphic map with Zariski dense image in \overline{A}.
Let D be an effective divisor on A which extends to a divisor \overline{D} on \overline{A}. Then, possibly after changing the compactification \overline{A} (depending only on D and independent of f), there exists a positive integer k\_{0}, depending on f and D, such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | T\_{f}(r,\overline{D})\leq N^{(k\_{0})}\_{f}(r,D)+S\_{f}(r,\overline{D}). |  |

The second part of this paper is to study meromorphic maps from {\mathbb{C}}^{p} to projective varieties, where p\geq 1 is an integer. We first establish the following version of the Second Main Theorem with truncation level one (see Theorem 1.4 in [4]). For related results, see also [11].
