be the k-th jet lift of f\_{\vec{a}\_{0}}.
Let Y\_{\vec{a}\_{0},k}=\pi\_{2}\!\big{(}X\_{k}(f\_{\vec{a}\_{0}})\big{)},
it follows from Lemma 6.4.5 in [13] that there exists an integral k\_{0} and a polynomial function
R\_{0}(w) in w\in\mathbb{C}^{nk\_{0}} such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | R\_{0}|\_{\pi\_{2}\big{(}J\_{k}(\overline{D};\log\partial A)\big{)}}\equiv 0,~{}~{% }~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}R\_{0}|\_{Y\_{\vec{a}\_{0},k\_{0}}}\not\equiv 0. |  |

Note here that R\_{0} depends on the vector \vec{a}\_{0}\in S\_{p}(1).

Denote by \pi:\mathbb{C}^{n}\to A the universal covering and let
\tilde{f}:z\in\mathbb{C}^{p}\mapsto\big{(}\tilde{f}\_{1}(z),\dots,\tilde{f}\_{n}%
(z)\big{)}\in\mathbb{C}^{n}
be a lift of f with \pi(\tilde{f})=f. Let
\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a}}(z)=\bigl{(}\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a},1}(z),\dots,\tilde{f}\_{\vec{%
a},n}(z)\bigr{)}.
Notice that R\_{0}|\_{Y\_{\vec{a}\_{0},k\_{0}}}\not\equiv 0 is equivalent to R\_{0}(\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a\_{0}}}^{\prime},\dots,\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a\_{0}}}^{(k\_{0})}%
)\not\equiv 0. Let
H(\vec{a},z)=R\_{0}(\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a}}^{\prime},\dots,\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a}}^{(k\_%
{0})}).
Then there exists z\_{0}\in\mathbb{C} with H(\vec{a}\_{0},z\_{0})\neq 0.
Thus the zero set
Z:=\{\vec{a}\in\mathbb{C}^{p}:H(\vec{a},z\_{0})=0\} is a proper analytic subset, so if we restrict it to the unit sphere
S\_{p}(1)\subset\mathbb{C}^{p}, then Z|\_{S\_{p}(1)} is of measure zero in S\_{p}(1).
Hence, for almost all \vec{a}\in S\_{p}(1), we have R\_{0}(\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a}}^{\prime},\dots,\tilde{f}\_{\vec{a}}^{(k\_{0})})\not\equiv
0.

Let \{U\_{j}\} be an affine open covering of \overline{A} such that the line bundle [\overline{D}] is
locally trivial over every U\_{j}.
We take a regular function \sigma\_{j} on each U\_{j} such that \sigma\_{j} is a defining function of \overline{D}\cap U\_{j}, i.e.
(\sigma\_{j})=\overline{D}|\_{U\_{j}}.
Fix a Hermitian metric \|\cdot\| on [\overline{D}].
Then there are positive smooth functions h\_{j} on U\_{j} such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|\sigma(x)\|=\frac{|\sigma\_{j}(x)|}{h\_{j}(x)},\qquad x\in U\_{j}, |  |

which is a well-defined function on \overline{A}.
We regard R\_{0} as a regular function on each U\_{j}\times\mathbb{C}^{nk\_{0}}.
Then we have the following equation on every U\_{j}\times\mathbb{C}^{nk\_{0}}

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2) |  | b\_{j0}\sigma\_{j}+b\_{j1}d\sigma\_{j}+\cdots+b\_{jk\_{0}}d^{k\_{0}}\sigma\_{j}=R\_{0}. |  |

Here each b\_{ji} is of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | b\_{ji}=\sum\_{\text{finite}}b\_{jil\beta\_{l}}(x)w\_{l}^{\beta\_{l}}, |  |

where b\_{jil\beta\_{l}}(x) are regular functions on U\_{j}, and w\_{l} are the coordinate functions of \mathbb{C}^{nk\_{0}}.
Thus, we infer that, in every U\_{j}

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \frac{1}{\|\sigma\|}=\frac{h\_{j}}{|\sigma\_{j}|}=\left|h\_{j}b\_{j0}+h\_{j}b\_{j1}% \frac{d\sigma\_{j}}{\sigma\_{j}}+\cdots+h\_{j}b\_{jk\_{0}}\frac{d^{k\_{0}}\sigma\_{j}% }{\sigma\_{j}}\right|\frac{1}{R\_{0}}. |  |
