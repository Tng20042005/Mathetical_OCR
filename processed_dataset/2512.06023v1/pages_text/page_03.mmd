###### Lemma 2.1 ([12]).

Let be T tree of order n\geqslant 5, a degree sequence d=(d\_{1},d\_{2},d\_{3},d\_{4},d\_{5}) where d\_{5}\geqslant d\_{4}\geqslant d\_{3}\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}, then Albertson index among tree T is:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{irr}(T)=d\_{1}^{2}+d\_{n}^{2}+\sum\_{i=2}^{n-1}\lvert d\_{i}-d\_{i+1}% \rvert+\sum\_{i=2}^{4}(d\_{i}+2)(d\_{i}-1)-2. |  |

Theorem 2.2 gives an inequality that restricts the spread of degree differences in a connected nonregular graph, using the minimum degree \delta and the maximum degree \Delta.

###### Theorem 2.2 ([10]).

Let G be a connected nonregular graph. Then, the Albertson index satisfy

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{uv\in E(G)}(\Delta-\delta)|d\_{G}(u)-d\_{G}(v)|=(\Delta-\delta)\mathrm{irr% }(G). |  |

### 2.1 Statement of Problem

This work focuses on establishing new bounds and inequalities for the Albertson index \operatorname{irr}(T) of trees T of order n, characterized by their degree sequences \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}). The Albertson index, a topological graph index measuring the irregularity of a graph, plays a significant role in extremal graph theory and its applications.

We investigate both the minimum and maximum values of \operatorname{irr}(T) for such trees, aiming to improve existing estimates and to describe extremal structures that achieve these bounds. Specifically, we study:

* •

  Lower bounds on the minimum Albertson index \operatorname{irr}\_{\min} involving the maximum degree \Delta and sums of degree powers (Propositions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3).
* •

  Upper and lower bounds on the maximum Albertson index \operatorname{irr}\_{\max}, including conditions depending on the degree sequence and maximum vertex degree (Propositions 4.1, Lemma 4.1).
* •

  Relationships between the minimum and maximum Albertson index values and their differences (Proposition 4.2).
* •

  New inequalities involving the Albertson index, vertex degrees, and other graph invariants expressed in Theorems 5.1 to 5.4 and associated corollaries, which provide explicit algebraic lower and upper bounds on \operatorname{irr}(T).
* •

  Special cases and expressions for degree sequences with ordering d\_{n}\geq d\_{n-1}\geq\dots\geq d\_{1}, as well as asymptotic and trigonometric forms related to the index.

The main goal is to contribute sharper estimates for \operatorname{irr}(T) in terms of vertex degree parameters and to clarify how these bounds vary with structural properties of the tree, thereby enriching the theory of graph irregularity and its applications in network analysis.
