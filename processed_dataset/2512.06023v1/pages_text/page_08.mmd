where (n-3)^{\lambda}>m(n-3)^{2}.

Then, from (22) we find that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}0\leqslant\frac{\sqrt{m(n-3)^{2}}}{(\Delta-1)^{4}}<\frac{\lambda}{4}. |  | (23) |

Inequality (23) holds if m\geqslant 0, \Delta\neq 1, and \lambda>0. Hence, the upper bound is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m\cdot(n-3)^{2}<\frac{\lambda^{2}}{16}\cdot(\Delta-1)^{8}. |  |

Therefore, from (23) the quantity associated with the maximum values of the Albertson index satisfies \operatorname{irr}\_{\max}>\lambda/4, and thus equation (21) is satisfied.
∎

Through Figure 3, we present a tree representing a practical application of the Albertson index (by considering Figure 1) by providing the maximum value of the Albertson index.
