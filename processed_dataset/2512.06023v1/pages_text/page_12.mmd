To prove the right-hand side of the inequality, consider that \alpha is the average of both d\_{1} and d\_{2}. We find that this value increases as m increases. Hence,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}(\Delta-1)^{3}\operatorname{irr}(T)>m\alpha^{3}+\lambda\_{\max}(n-1). |  | (44) |

From (44), when \delta\geqslant 2 we note that \operatorname{irr}(T)<n+\lambda\delta^{2} and \operatorname{irr}(T)<m\alpha^{3}+\lambda\_{\max}(n-1). Then, assuming \lambda\_{\max}\approx\lambda satisfies

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(T)\leq\frac{m\alpha^{3}+\lambda\_{\max}(n-1)}{n+4\lambda% \delta^{2}}. |  | (45) |

Thus, from (45) we observe that the right-hand side of the inequality (42) holds.

Actually, Theorem 5.3 establishes explicit lower and upper bounds for the irregularity \operatorname{irr}(T) of a tree in terms of its number of vertices n, edges m, maximum degree \Delta, it offers a deeper understanding of how a tree’s irregularity relates simultaneously to degree sequence. This insight facilitates the classification of trees based on spectral and combinatorial features.

###### Theorem 5.4.

Let T be a tree with n vertices and m edges. Then, the upper bound for the Albertson index satisfies

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(T)\leqslant\alpha\left\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\right\rfloor+% \beta\left\lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil. |  | (46) |

###### Proof.

According to Corollary 5.1, the lower bound of the Albertson index is given in (41). Thus, we note that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\sqrt{\Delta(\Delta-1)^{2}}\leqslant\left\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\right\rfloor+% \left\lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil<\operatorname{irr}(T). |  | (47) |

Then, from (47) we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\left\lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil=\begin{cases}m+1,&\text{if }n<1,\\ m+2,&\text{if }n\geqslant 1.\end{cases} |  | (48) |

Therefore, if we want to treat it as a function, it can be generated by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\right\rfloor+\left\lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil=f(% x)=\frac{x^{2}(x+1)+x^{2}+1}{(x-1)^{2}(x^{2}+x+1)}. |  |

It holds for the sum in (47) as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\left\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\right\rfloor+\left\lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil% =m+\left\lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil=\begin{cases}2m+1,&n<1,\\ 2m+2,&n\geqslant 1.\end{cases} |  | (49) |

Thus, from (48) and (49) we find that according to (47), it holds that \sqrt{\Delta(\Delta-1)^{2}}\leqslant n+1<\operatorname{irr}(T). Then,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(T)\geqslant\alpha\left\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\right\rfloor+% \sqrt{\Delta(\Delta-1)^{2}},\quad\operatorname{irr}(T)\geqslant\beta\left% \lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil+\sqrt{\Delta(\Delta-1)^{2}}. |  | (50) |

Finally, from (50) we conclude that (47) holds.

###### Corollary 5.2.

Let T be a tree with n vertices and m edges, according to Theorem 5.4 for n\in\mathbb{R} and \frac{2n}{3}\notin\mathbb{Z}. Then,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\left\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\right\rfloor+\left\lceil\frac{2n+1}{3}\right\rceil% =\frac{5}{6}+\frac{2n}{3}+\left\lfloor\frac{2n}{3}\right\rfloor+\frac{1}{\pi}% \sum\_{k=1}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sin{\left(\frac{2\pi k+4\pi nk}{3}\right)}\right). |  | (51) |
