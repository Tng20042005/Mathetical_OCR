Figure 3: A practical application of the Albertson index.

In fact, through Lemma 4.2 establishes a lower bound on the Albertson index of a tree based on its degree sequence.

###### Lemma 4.2.

Let T be a tree of order n with degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) where d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}. Then, the Albertson index satisfy

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\frac{2n\sqrt{2n}}{4}<\frac{(n^{2}-2m)\Delta\sqrt{2mn}}{2m\lambda\sqrt{2m}}% \leqslant\operatorname{irr}(T). |  | (24) |

###### Proof.

Assume a degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) where d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}. Clearly, \Delta\leqslant\lambda\varphi where we consider \varphi\approx 1.66, notice that d\_{n}-d\_{n-1}>d\_{2}, d\_{n-1}-d\_{n-2}>d\_{2},\dots, which indicate sufficient irregularity in the degree sequence. Thus, by considering the constant term is d\_{n}^{2}+d\_{1}^{2}+d\_{n}-d\_{1}-2n+2, which is used to form a lower bound on the Albertson index. Then, the Albertson index satisfy

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}2n\sqrt{2n}<\lambda\operatorname{irr}(T). |  | (25) |

This relation leads us to, through the ratio achieved for the arithmetic mean of the elements of the given degree sequence \lambda and the maximum degree \Delta as n^{2}\leqslant\frac{3\Delta}{\lambda}. It follows that an upper bound on \operatorname{irr}(T) satisfy

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(T)\leqslant\frac{2\lambda mn^{2}-4\Delta n-n^{3}}{4m% \sqrt{2m}}. |  | (26) |

Therefore, by combining the inequalities (25) and (26), we deduce
\sqrt{2\lambda mn^{2}}>\operatorname{irr}(T). Then,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 4\Delta(d\_{n}-d\_{n-1})<(n^{2}-2m)\Delta, |  |

where is satisfy the relationship (n^{2}-2m)\Delta\sqrt{2mn}>\operatorname{irr}(T)+4\Delta(d\_{n}-d\_{n-1}). Thus,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}(n^{2}-2m)\Delta\sqrt{2mn}>\operatorname{irr}(T)+4\Delta(d\_{n-k}-d\_{k}), |  | (27) |

where \Delta<k<n. Then, we noticed that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\frac{(n^{2}-2m)\Delta\sqrt{2mn}}{2m\lambda\sqrt{2m}}\leqslant\operatorname% {irr}(T). |  | (28) |

Through this relation, the upper bound has been proven. From (28) establishes a further lower bound for the Albertson index. Hence, for the left-hand side, by testing the ratio of the number of vertices to the number of edges, it satisfies 2\Delta n>m/n and 2n\sqrt{2n}>2\Delta. Then, according to (27) and (28) we find that
