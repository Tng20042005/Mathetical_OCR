## 5 The Effect of Bounds on Albertson Index

Theorem 5.1 establishes a lower bound for the Albertson index of a tree T with n vertices and m edges, characterized by its degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) arranged in non-decreasing order. The average degree \lambda multiplied by n, and a term depending on the product of the minimum and maximum degrees \delta and \Delta.

###### Theorem 5.1.

Let T be a tree with n vertices and m edges, having degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) where d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}, minimum degree \delta(T), and maximum degree \Delta(T). Then, the Albertson index satisfies

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(T)\geqslant\sum\_{i=2}^{n}d\_{i}^{2}-d\_{1}+3mn-2\left% \lfloor\frac{3n^{2}-1}{2}\right\rfloor+\frac{3}{4}\lambda n-5\delta\Delta. |  | (31) |

###### Proof.

Assume a tree T with degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) where d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}, minimum degree \delta(T), and maximum degree \Delta(T). According to Lemma 2.1, we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(T)>\sqrt{2mn+n\delta(n-1)}. |  | (32) |

Thus, the term 2mn<n\delta(n-1) satisfies 2mn<2\Delta(\Delta-1)^{2}<n\delta(n-1) where \delta>2 and \lambda n>\Delta. Hence, from (32) for n\geqslant 4, indicating that stars with sufficiently many vertices satisfy the condition, possibly due to their high irregularity. Therefore, by considering the inequality 2\Delta<(n-1)^{2}, we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\left\lfloor\frac{3n^{2}-1}{2}\right\rfloor<2\Delta(\Delta-1)^{2}. |  | (33) |

Thus, we observe that \operatorname{irr}(T)>\frac{3}{4}\lambda n-5\delta\Delta. Then, by considering 3mn and the fact that m=n-1, it follows that 3mn=3n^{2}-3n. Then,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\sum\_{i=2}^{n}d\_{i}^{2}-d\_{1}+3mn-2\left\lfloor\frac{3n^{2}-1}{2}\right% \rfloor>\frac{3}{4}\lambda n-5\delta\Delta. |  | (34) |

Therefore, through the discussion presented in the relations (33) and (34), it follows from the comparison of the two quantities in (33) that relation (31) holds. Thus, we find that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(T)>\sum\_{i=2}^{n}d\_{i}^{2}-d\_{1}+3mn-2\left\lfloor\frac{% 3n^{2}-1}{2}\right\rfloor. |  | (35) |

Finally, by considering \operatorname{irr}(T)>\frac{3}{4}\lambda n-5\delta\Delta, the inequalities (32)–(35) imply (31).
∎

According to Theorem 5.1, its significance stems from regulating the degree distribution and spectral characteristics of trees (especially through (34)), probably to promote significant irregularity (e.g., a high Albertson or Sigma index) or to prioritize trees with elevated maximum degrees, such as star graphs. This concept is pertinent in fields like chemical graph theory, network optimization, and extremal graph theory. Providing more details about \lambda or the specific tree type could enhance the analysis.

To assess the influence of the Albertson index on graphs and trees based on the discussion presented in Table 2, we illustrate in Figure 4 the Albertson index applied to a connected graph, highlighting the extent of its effect.

Theorem 5.2 establishes a lower bound for the Albertson index of a tree with degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) arranged in non-increasing order, where \Delta(T) denotes the maximum degree, the Albertson index \operatorname{irr}(T) satisfies the inequality (36), where \lambda is the average degree of the vertices in \mathscr{D}. This result quantifies how the degree distribution and maximum degree constrain the irregularity measured by the Albertson index.

###### Theorem 5.2.

Let T be a tree with n vertices and m edges, and degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) where d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}, and let \Delta(T) denote its maximum degree. Then, the Albertson index satisfies
