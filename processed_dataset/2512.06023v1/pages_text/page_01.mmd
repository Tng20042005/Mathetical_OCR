###### Abstract

In this paper, we presents novel and sharp bounds on the Albertson index of trees, revealing deep connections between degree sequences and graph irregularity where the Albertson index of Caterpillar tree satisfy

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{irr}(G)=\left({{d\_{n}}-1}\right)^{2}+\left({d\_{1}-1}\right)^{2}+% \sum\limits\_{i=2}^{n-1}{\left({{d\_{i}}-1}\right)\left({{d\_{i}}-2}\right)}+\sum% \_{i=1}^{n-1}|d\_{i}-d\_{i+1}|. |  |

We derive powerful inequalities that precisely characterize the minimum and maximum values of the Albertson index, incorporating intricate dependencies on vertex degrees, edge counts, and the average of elements in degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) where d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}. Our results not only improve existing extremal bounds but also uncover striking relationships between the structure of trees and their irregularity measurements. These advances open new avenues for the analysis of graph irregularity and contribute essential tools for the study of degree-based topological indices in combinatorial graph theory.

## 1 Introduction

Throughout this paper. Let G=(V,E) be a simple, connected graph, where n=|V(G)|, m=|E(G)|. The study of structural irregularity in graphs has garnered increasing attention in both theoretical and applied contexts, particularly in mathematical chemistry, network analysis, and algorithmic graph theory. A graph is said to be regular if all of its vertices have equal degrees; otherwise, it exhibits some degree of irregularity. Accurately quantifying this irregularity is essential for modeling complex systems and understanding the behavior of real-world networks.

One of the earliest and most influential measures of graph irregularity is the *Albertson index*, introduced in [3, 10], and defined for a simple graph G=(V,E) as:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathrm{irr}(G)=\sum\_{uv\in E(G)}|\deg\_{G}(u)-\deg\_{G}(v)|, |  |

where \deg\_{G}(u) denotes the degree of vertex u. This index captures local disparities between adjacent vertex degrees and has inspired numerous variants and generalizations [1, 2]. The extremal behavior [7] of degree irregularities in trees is characterized by trees that either minimize or maximize irregularity indices based on their degree sequences. Greedy trees [7] typically minimize irregularity measures like the \sigma-irregularity by distributing degrees evenly, whereas adopting or similarly structured extremal trees maximize irregularity by creating larger degree differences between adjacent vertices. Among [6, 9, 15] provides a comprehensive overview of spectral graph theory, including how irregularity affects eigenvalues like \lambda where \lambda considered as the spectral radius or algebraic connectivity and their role in network properties. In [4] covers extremal graph theory and discusses how irregularity influences graph properties like degree distributions and connectivity.

Two of the earliest established topological graph indices are the first and second Zagreb indices, introduced in 1972 by Gutman and Trinajstic [11]. These indices are frequently cited because of their applications in QSAR and QSPR studies. Beyond general graphs, a growing body of literature has focused on trees with constrained degree sequences. Studies by Molloy and Reed [13] and Broutin and Marckert [5] explored their asymptotic behavior, while Zhang et al. [18] investigated realizability and enumeration under degree constraints. These results have proven instrumental in analyzing extremal irregularity measures in structured tree families.

Among such families, *caterpillar trees*—characterized by a linear backbone with attached pendant vertices—have emerged as key models in chemical graph theory [17]. Their tractable structure allows the derivation of explicit analytical expressions. While prior work [8, 16] has examined irregularity bounds in these trees, closed-form expressions for both the Albertson and Sigma indices remain scarce.

The aim of this paper is to establish new bounds, inequalities, and refined estimates for the Albertson index of trees in terms of their order, size, and degree sequences. It focuses on deriving minimum and maximum values as well as lower and upper bounds for the Albertson index, often presenting these results through propositions, lemmas, theorems, and corollaries that relate the index to structural parameters like vertex degrees, maximum and minimum degrees, and combinatorial expressions.

This paper is organized as follows. Through Section 3, we explore bounds on the minimum Albertson index, \operatorname{irr}\_{\min}, for a tree T of order n with degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}), where the degrees are ordered such that d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\cdots\geqslant d\_{1}. In Section 5, we presented the upper bounds of the maximum value of Albertson index by considering the value of Albertson index. Section 5 provide a study of the effect bounds on Albertson index.

## 2 Preliminaries

In this section, we review the most important basic concepts that we will use in establishing this research. Yang J, Deng H., M., [19] provide 1\leq p\leq n-3. Then: \Delta(G)=n-1. Through [14] consider For any connected simple graph G has not satisfied with the null graphs and path graphs, the Albertson index satisfy \operatorname{irr}(G^{\*})=\operatorname{irr}(G)+2. For Caterpillar tree [12] with path vertices with degrees d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}, we have:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}(G)=\left({{d\_{n}}-1}\right)^{2}+\left({d\_{1}-1}\right)^{% 2}+\sum\limits\_{i=2}^{n-1}{\left({{d\_{i}}-1}\right)\left({{d\_{i}}-2}\right)}+% \sum\_{i=1}^{n-1}|d\_{i}-d\_{i+1}|. |  | (1) |

According to (1), we consider the Albertson index had given by Proposition 2.1, where the graph G be a regular graph.
