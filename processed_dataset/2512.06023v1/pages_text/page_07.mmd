|  | ~{}\alpha d\_{1}+\beta d\_{2}>\left\lfloor\frac{2n\Delta}{m}\right\rfloor+\left% \lceil\frac{2\Delta m}{n}\right\rceil. |  | (18) |

Hence, from (17), we obtain rough bounds for the values of 2m/n and 2n/m. Therefore, from (18) we deduce that for the term \alpha d\_{1}+\beta d\_{2}+\alpha d\_{3}+\beta d\_{4}+\dots+\alpha d\_{n-1}+\beta d%
\_{n}, where

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \alpha d\_{1}<\beta d\_{2}<\alpha d\_{3}<\dots<\alpha d\_{n-1}+\beta d\_{n}, |  |

and according to 2^{\alpha}m(m+1)\leqslant\alpha^{4}\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}(T), it follows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2m(m+1)\leqslant\alpha^{2}\operatorname{irr}\_{\max}(T). |  |

Then, the upper bound of the maximum value of the Albertson index is given by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\operatorname{irr}\_{\max}<\alpha\sum\_{i=1}^{n}d\_{2i-1}+\beta\sum\_{i=1}^{n}d% \_{2i}+(\Delta-3)^{2}. |  | (19) |

Hence, from (19) for d\_{1}\geqslant 10 and d\_{n}\gg d\_{1} we notice that 2^{\alpha}>\operatorname{irr}\_{\max}. Thus, the relation (16) holds for \alpha, and according to the term 2^{\beta}>2^{\alpha} satisfying 2^{\beta}>\operatorname{irr}\_{\max}, the relation (16) also holds for \beta when d\_{1}>3. As desired.

For each degree sequence \operatorname{irr}\_{\max} and \operatorname{irr}\_{\min} values are given and are relatively close, indicating that for these graphs. Through Table 2, we noticed for a given the degree sequence, the maximum and minimum irredundance numbers indicate the variety and bounds of the irredundant vertex sets in terms of size.In fact, both \alpha and \beta represent theoretical bounds or empirical parameters to predict or estimate irredundance based on the degrees.

Table 2: The maximum and minimum value of Albertson index with \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},d\_{3},d\_{4},d\_{5}).

For a degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}), let \lambda be the average of elements \mathscr{D}. Then, we noticed that among (20) the relationship between the number of vertices and \lambda had provided as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}n=\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(2d\_{i}-\lambda). |  | (20) |

Proposition 4.2 establishes that for any tree T of order n,
the difference between the minimum and maximum values of the Albertson index is bounded above by a constant \lambda.
Furthermore, Lemma 4.1 refines this by showing that for a tree with degree sequence
\mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}), the maximum Albertson index satisfies the inequality (21), thus providing an explicit upper bound in terms of the maximum degree and parameters related to the structure of T.

###### Proposition 4.2.

Let T be a tree of order n, \operatorname{irr}\_{\min} be the minimum value (\operatorname{irr}\_{\max} be the maximum value, respectively) of the Albertson index. Then, the difference between \operatorname{irr}\_{\min} and \operatorname{irr}\_{\max} satisfy D(\operatorname{irr}\_{\min},\operatorname{irr}\_{\max})\leqslant\lambda.

###### Lemma 4.1.

Let T be a tree of order n given in (20) with degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}). Then, the maximum value of the Albertson index satisfies

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\frac{\sqrt{m(n-3)^{2}}\operatorname{irr}\_{\max}}{(\Delta-1)^{4}}<\lambda. |  | (21) |

###### Proof.

Assume \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) is a degree sequence with d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}, and the number of vertices is given in (20). We consider three terms: \sqrt{m(n-3)^{2}}, \operatorname{irr}\_{\max}, and (\Delta-1)^{4}, in relation to the value of \lambda. We analyze their relationships to prove the validity of relation (21) connecting these terms.

Since clearly \operatorname{irr}\_{\max}>\lambda, for the maximum value of the Albertson index, the relation

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\sqrt{m(n-3)^{\lambda}}>\lambda(\Delta-1)^{4} |  | (22) |

holds, where \lambda>2.

Because \lambda>2 satisfies \lambda n^{2}<n^{(\lambda+1)/2}, and considering the value of \lambda yields 2^{\lambda/2}>4(n-1), it follows that 2^{\lambda}>\Delta. Thus, we observe that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sqrt{\lambda(n-3)}\operatorname{irr}\_{\max}>\lambda(\Delta-1)^{4}, |  |
