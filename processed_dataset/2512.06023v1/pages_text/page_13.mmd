Through this paper, we provide significant new bounds and structural insights regarding the Albertson index for trees based on their degree sequences. We have derived explicit inequalities that tightly constrain both the minimum and maximum values of the Albertson index, connecting them to important graph parameters such as the maximum degree, number of edges, and degree sums and powers.

In particular, Propositions 3.1–3.3 give lower bounds that relate the minimal Albertson index to degree cubics and quadratics, illustrating the influence of degree irregularity distribution in trees. Propositions 4.1 and 4.2, together with Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2, further characterize upper bounds and the gap between minimal and maximal index values, highlighting how degree extrema and combinatorial parameters limit the Albertson index variability. The main Theorems 5.1–5.4 consolidate these findings to provide comprehensive lower and upper bounds for the Albertson index in terms of degree sequences, maximum and minimum degrees, and auxiliary parameters \lambda,\alpha,\beta. These bounds integrate various combinatorial components such as floor and ceiling functions, reinforcing the discrete nature of the problem. Corollaries 5.1 and 5.2 offer refined numeric and analytic expressions that complement the theoretical results and enable practical computation of Albertson index estimates.

This work advances the understanding of the Albertson index as a metric of graph irregularity by furnishing sharp, degree-sequence-dependent bounds for trees. These results are expected to facilitate further research on extremal problems in topological indices and to support applications where degree irregularity must be quantitatively controlled or estimated. Future extensions may consider more general graph classes or explore algorithmic approaches for exact index computation based on these theoretical foundations.
