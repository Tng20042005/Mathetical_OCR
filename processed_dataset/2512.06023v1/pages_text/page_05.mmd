###### Proof.

Assume a degree sequence \mathscr{D}=(d\_{1},d\_{2},\dots,d\_{n}) ordered such that d\_{n}\geqslant d\_{n-1}\geqslant\dots\geqslant d\_{2}\geqslant d\_{1}. Then, for T a connected graph with n vertices and m edges, suppose it satisfies \operatorname{irr}\_{\min}<m(m+1). Thus, the minimum value of the Albertson index satisfies

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2^{\alpha}m(m+1)\leqslant\alpha^{4}\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}(T). |  |

Then,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\alpha\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}(T)\geqslant\sum\_{i=1}^{n}d\_{i}^{2}. |  | (13) |

Therefore, the relation (13) grows by combining the term 2^{\alpha}m(m+1) where \beta<2^{\alpha}, considering \operatorname{irr}\_{\min}<m(m+1). Thus, from (13) we find that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{irr}\_{\min}\leqslant n(2m-n+\Delta) |  |

where 0<\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}/2^{\alpha}<n. This condition is used to restrict the values of \alpha in order to reach Equation (12). Therefore, we clearly observe the impact of this condition on Equation (14), as it provides a clear path to reach the desired result. Then,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\frac{\beta m(m+1)}{\alpha}\geqslant\sum\_{i=1}^{n}d\_{i}^{2},\quad\frac{% \beta m(m+1)}{\alpha}+2^{\alpha}m(m+1)\geqslant\alpha^{4}\operatorname{irr}(T). |  | (14) |

Thus, from (14) we obtain

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | ~{}\frac{\beta m(m+1)}{\alpha}+2^{\alpha}m(m+1)\geqslant\sum\_{i=1}^{n}d\_{i}^{3}, |  | (15) |

by considering the term 2^{-\alpha}\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}<n which satisfies 2^{\alpha}m(m+1)>\alpha\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}(T). Then, from (15) and by considering (14) and (13), we conclude that Equation (12) holds as desired.

Through the previously presented study through Propositions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, we clarify these relationships and their impact using Table 1 in order to calculate the minimum values of the Peterson index by providing an increasing nested sequence. Denote to \frac{\beta m(m+1)}{\alpha}+\alpha\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}(T) by L\_{3}, \operatorname{irr}\_{\min}-\left(\sum\_{i=1}^{n}d\_{i}^{2}+2d\_{1}+d\_{2}-3d\_{3}+2(%
d\_{n-1}+d\_{n})\right) by L\_{2} and \frac{2\operatorname{irr}\_{\min}}{\Delta(\Delta-1)^{2}} by L\_{1}.

| Degrees | L\_{1} | L\_{2} | L\_{3} | Degrees | L\_{1} | L\_{2} | L\_{3} |

| (4,8,9,13,15) | 0.4 | 6 | 9052 | (5,10,12,16,18) | 0.3 | 1 | 15046 |

Table 1: Calculate the minimum values of Albertson index.

This values should help understand extremal bounds and behavior of irregularity indices in trees (see Figure 2), providing both numeric evidence and theoretical confirmation of the indices’ dependency on the degree structure. The indices help measure the degree irregularity of the graph, quantifying how far the graph’s degree distribution deviates from regularity.
