Let M be a {\bf d}-dimensional representation of Q and let
{\bf e}\in{\mathbb{Z}}\_{\geq 0}^{Q\_{0}}
be a dimension vector such that e\_{i}\leq d\_{i} for all i\in Q\_{0}. The universal quiver Grassmannian
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\bf e}({\bf d}) sits inside the product {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}\times\prod\_{i\in Q\_{0}}\mathrm{Gr}\_{e\_{i}}({\mathbf{k}}^{d\_{%
i}})
and consists of collections \{f\_{\alpha}\}\_{\alpha\in Q\_{1}},(U\_{i})\_{i\in Q\_{0}} such that
f\_{\alpha}(U\_{s(\alpha)})\subset U\_{t(\alpha)} for all \alpha\in Q\_{1}. One has two natural
projections

for M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} we denote by \mathrm{Gr}\_{\bf e}(M) the fiber of the projection \mathrm{Gr}\_{\bf e}\to{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} over the point M.

Let us fix a projective representation P and an injective representation I;
thus P is a direct sum of the modules P\_{i} with certain multiplicities and
I is a direct sum of the modules I\_{i} with certain multiplicities. Let

We are interested in quiver Grassmannians \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) for M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}
being {\bf d}-dimensional
Q-module. In other words, we want to study the fibers of the universal quiver Grassmannian
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(P+I) (over the representation space {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}). Following
suggestion of Markus Reineke we call these quiver Grassmannians PrIncipal (Pr for projectives and In for injectives).

Since Q is Dynkin, the group G\_{\bf d} has a finite number of orbits in {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}.
Hence there exists a unique open orbit \mathcal{O}(M^{0}) (for a rigid representation M^{0}), which
degenerates to any other orbit and a special fiber \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0}) of \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}({\bf d}).
Yet another special fiber is given by \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(P\oplus I) (since
{\bf d}=\dim P+\dim I).

###### Remark 2.2.

For any M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} the quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is non-empty.
In fact, one knows [Scho92] that this statement is implied by the inequalities
