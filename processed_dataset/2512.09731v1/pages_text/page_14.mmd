Now let us consider the D\_{4} quiver with all vertices pointing to the central vertex

###### Proposition 5.8.

Let Q the a quiver with vertices 1,2,3,4 and arrows 1\to 2, 3\to 2 and 4\to 2. Let P=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}P\_{i}, I=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}I\_{i}.
Then there exists a unique representations M^{2} in {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} such that
\dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)=\langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle if and only if M degenerates to M^{2}.

Let us provide the details in this case.
One has

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | {\bf d}=(3,5,3,3),\ \dim P=(1,4,1,1),\ \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle=7 |  |

and

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}=2V(1,0,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,0)\oplus 2V(0,1,0,0)\oplus V(0,1,1,0)\oplus\\ 2V(0,0,1,0)\oplus V(0,1,0,1)\oplus 2V(0,0,0,1). |  |

The quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{2}) has 8 irreducible components of dimension 7.

Finally, let us mention that for Q of type D\_{5} of the form

one also gets three deepest representations M^{2} such that the corresponding quiver Grassmannian
is of the expected (minimal possible) dimension.

## 6. The homomorphism dimension criterion

The goal of this section is to formulate a criterion for a representation N to belong to \Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) in terms of dimensions of certain homomorphism spaces.

We start with the following observation, which has to do with the description of \Gamma\_{\bf d}(1):

* •

  for every indecomposable injective X=I\_{j}, \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M^{1},X)={\bf d}\_{j},
