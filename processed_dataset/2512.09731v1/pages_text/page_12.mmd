The corresponding
quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{2}) is equidimensional, of expected dimension n(n+1)/2 and has
the Catalan number irreducible components.

Let us adjust the description (5.1) above to the conjectural answer in type A for general orientation. We decompose
Q into the union of several equioriented type A quivers
Q=Q(1)\cup\dots\cup Q(r) such that for each \ell the quivers
Q(\ell) and Q(\ell+1) have a unique common vertex i(\ell)\in Q\_{0}. Let M^{2}(\ell) be the deepest representation
(5.1) corresponding to the equioriented quiver Q(\ell). In particular, each M^{2}(\ell) contains summands of the form
2S(i) for i being the leftmost and the rightmost vertices of Q(\ell).

We put forward the following conjectures:

###### Conjecture 5.4.

Let Q be of type A with the decomposition Q=\cup\_{\ell=1}^{r}Q(\ell), Q(\ell)\cap Q(\ell+1)=i\_{\ell}. Let also P=\bigoplus\_{j\in Q\_{0}}P\_{j} and I=\bigoplus\_{j\in Q\_{0}}I\_{j}. Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}=\bigoplus\_{\ell=1}^{r}M^{2}(\ell)-2\bigoplus\_{a=1}^{r-1}S\_{i\_{a}}, |  |

where the subtraction means that we remove two summands of the form S\_{i\_{a}}, 1\leq a<r from the decomposition of
\bigoplus\_{\ell=1}^{r}M^{2}(\ell) into the direct sum of indecomposable representations.

###### Conjecture 5.5.

Let P=\bigoplus\_{j}u\_{j}^{P}P\_{j}, I=\bigoplus\_{j}u\_{j}^{I}I\_{j} with all u\_{j}^{P},u\_{j}^{I}\neq 0. Let also M^{2}(P,I) be the corresponding deepest representation with minimal dimension Grassmannian. Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}(P\oplus P^{\prime},I\oplus I)=M^{2}(P,I)\oplus P^{\prime}\oplus I^{% \prime}. |  |

In the case if some u\_{j}^{P} or u\_{j}^{I} are zero, the exact form of M^{2} is not entirely clear for us yet. In some cases Conjecture 5.5 still holds, in some it doesn’t.

We provide some concrete examples below.

### 5.2. Zig-zag case

We continue using the notation U(i,j) for the indecomposable A\_{n} module
supported on vertices between i and j (for arbitrary orientation).
In the following Conjecture we consider quiver A\_{n} with alternating orientation.

###### Conjecture 5.6.

Let Q be of type A\_{n} with alternating orientation (a “zig-zag quiver”). Then M^{2} is written as
\bigoplus\_{i=1}^{n-1}U(i,i+1)\oplus 2\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}S\_{i}. The quiver Grassmannian
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{2}) has 2^{n-1} irreducible components each of dimension 2n-1.

### 5.3. A\_{5} example

Let us consider an n=5 example. Let Q be as follows:
1\rightarrow 2\leftarrow 3\leftarrow 4\leftarrow 5. Then the representation M^{2}
is given by the following formula:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}=2U(1,1)+U(1,2)+2U(2,2)+U(2,3)+U(3,3)+U(2,4)+\\ U(4,4)+U(2,5)+U(3,5)+U(4,5)+2U(5,5). |  |
