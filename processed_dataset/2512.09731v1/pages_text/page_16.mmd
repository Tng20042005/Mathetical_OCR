Then \Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) has a single sink

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle M^{2}= | \displaystyle 2V(1,0,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,0)\oplus V(0,1,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,1,0)\oplus |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle 2V(0,0,1,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,1)\oplus 2V(0,0,0,1), |  |

such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M^{2},V(0,1,1,1))=4=\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,V(0,1,1,1))+2. |  |

This case has one more peculiarity: the set of representations N such that \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(N,X)\leq\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X)+1, for all non-injective indecomposable X, has four sinks instead of one or three. At the same time, M^{1} in this case coincides with P\oplus I.

On the other hand, if Q and I are the same and P=P\_{1}\oplus P\_{2}\oplus P\_{4}, the conjecture holds.

## 7. Plücker algebras and line bundles

Recall the the notation a\_{i}=\dim P\_{i} and the
standard closed embedding \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)\hookrightarrow\prod\_{i\in Q\_{0}}\mathrm{Gr}\_{a\_{i}}(M\_%
{i}). Each Grassmann
variety admits the Plücker embedding into the projective space {\mathbb{P}}(\Lambda^{a\_{i}})(M\_{i}).
Let \mathcal{O}\_{i}(m) be the line bundle on \mathrm{Gr}\_{a\_{i}}(M\_{i}) obtained as a pullback of \mathcal{O}(m)
on {\mathbb{P}}(\Lambda^{a\_{i}}(M\_{i})).
For {\bf m}\in{\mathbb{Z}}\_{\geq 0}^{Q\_{0}} we denote by \mathcal{O}({\bf m}) the exterior tensor product
\prod\_{i\in Q\_{0}}\mathcal{O}\_{i}(m\_{i}), which is a line bundle on the product of Grassmannians. We use the
same symbol \mathcal{O}({\bf m}) to denote the restriction to the quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M).

Recall the multi-homogeneous ideals {\mathcal{I}}(M) inside the polynomial ring in Plücker variables
\Delta^{(i)}\_{J} which defines the reduced scheme structure of the quiver Grassmannians
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M). The multi-graded Plücker algebra admits the decomposition

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | {\rm Pl}(M)={\mathbb{C}}[\Delta\_{J}^{(i)}]/{\mathcal{I}}(M)=\bigoplus\_{{\bf m}% \in{\mathbb{Z}}\_{\geq 0}^{Q\_{0}}}{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M), |  |

where the homogeneous component {\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M) is spanned by all the monomials of the form
