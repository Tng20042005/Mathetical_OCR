###### Conjecture D.

Let either of the following two conditions holds:
a) Q is of type A and neither \dim P nor \dim I have zero components,
b) Q is of type D and P\oplus I contains every indecomposable projective and every indecomposable injective representation as a summand.
Then \dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)=\langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle if and only if

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M,X)\leq\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X)+1 |  |

for every non-injective indecomposable representation X.

If Conjecture D holds, M^{2} is described as a representation with maximal possible values of \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(N,X) not exceeding \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X)+1.

Finally, we consider the Plücker algebras (the homogeneous coordinate rings)
{\rm Pl}(M), M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} of the quiver Grassmannians \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M).
These algebras are defined as the quotients of the polynomial ring in all Plücker
variables by the defining ideal {\mathcal{I}}(M) responsible for the reduced
scheme structure of our quiver Grassmannians. Let {\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M) be the homogeneous
components of {\rm Pl}(M).

###### Conjecture E.

Let Q be any Dynkin quiver with any orientation and let P and I be
multiplicity free (i.e. each indecomposable summand shows up at most once).
Then for M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} one has

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M)=\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0})\text{ for all }{\bf m} |  |

if and only if \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is of dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle.
For arbitrary M one has \dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M)\geq\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0})
for all {\bf m}.

We note that Conjecture E does not hold for arbitrary projective P and injective I (even in type A).
At the same time, the conjectural flatness of the equi-dimensional (of minimal dimension) family of quiver Grassmannians
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) implies that the Euler characteristic of the natural line bundles
induced by the natural maps to {\mathbb{P}}(\Lambda^{(\dim P)\_{i}}M\_{i}) are constant along the
fibers. It is tempting to conjecture that for the multiplicity free P and I
the components of the Plücker algebra are isomorphic to the zero cohomology groups
of the corresponding line bundles and that the higher cohomology vanish. However,
at the moment we do not have enough evidence to conjecture that this indeed holds true.

Finally. let us outline couple of possible further directions. First, the principal quiver Grassmannians for equioriented type A quivers enjoy many nice topological and combinatorial properties [Bi14, CI20, CFFFR20, CFR13-1, Fe12-2].
It would be interesting to extend the study to the case of general quivers.
Second, a quiver Grassmannian of subrepresentations of M is naturally acted upon by the group of automorphisms of M.
The description of this action and of the induced action on the homogeneous coordinate rings will lead to a better understanding of
geometric and algebraic properties of the quiver Grassmannians
(see [Ar11, CFR17, Fe23, FFL11, HT99] for some partial results).
