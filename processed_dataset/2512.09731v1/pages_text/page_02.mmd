by quadratic relations labeled by the edges \alpha\in Q\_{1}. However, in most cases this scheme structure
is not reduced. One can also naturally define quadratic relations for each path in Q. Here is our first
conjecture.

###### Conjecture A.

For every principal quiver Grassmannian the scheme structure defined by the quadratic relations
corresponding to all paths in Q is reduced.

The representation space {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} is naturally acted upon by the group G\_{\bf d}, the product
of GL\_{d\_{i}} for all i\in Q\_{0}. Since Q is Dynkin, there is a unique open orbit for this action;
let M^{0} be an element of this open orbit.
Then \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0}) is irreducible and of dimension
\langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle; hence for any {\bf d}-dimensional M the dimension of \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0})
is at least \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle
(see [CFR12]). We say that M degenerates to N (M,N\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}),
if N is contained in the closure of the G\_{\bf d} orbit of M.
We put forward the following conjecture.

###### Conjecture B.

There exists a representation
M^{1} of dimension \dim P such that a quiver Grassmannian
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(N), N\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} is irreducible of dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle if and only if N degenerates to M^{1}.
If \dim P and \dim Q have no zero components, then M^{1}=P\oplus I.

From [CFR13-1], we already know that any representation degenerating to P\oplus I is of dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle. Conjecture B is proved in [CFFFR17, CFFFR20] for equioriented type A quiver in certain special cases.

Another natural question to ask is for which representations N
the quiver Grassmannians \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(N) are of the expected (minimal possible)
dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle.
Some special cases of this question were investigated in [CFFFR17], [CFFFR20]. Here is our third conjecture.

###### Conjecture C.

Let Q be of type A with arbitrary orientation. There exists a representation
M^{2} of dimension \dim P such that a quiver Grassmannian
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(N), N\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} is of dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle if and only if N degenerates to M^{2}.

In words, Conjecture C states that there exists the deepest quiver
Grassmannian of the minimal possible dimension. We give a conjectural description of M^{2} in some special cases.
We note that if Conjecture C holds true then the subvariety of the
universal quiver Grassmannian consisting of fibers over representations degenerating
to M^{2} is flat ([CFFFR17, CFFFR20]).
We also note that Conjecture C does not hold in general: in type D\_{4} for certain
representations P and I there exist
three deepest quiver Grassmannians of the minimal possible dimension.

A universal description of minimal dimension locus is conjecturally given, under quite lax restrictions, in terms of dimensions of homomorphism spaces. Here’s our next conjecture:
