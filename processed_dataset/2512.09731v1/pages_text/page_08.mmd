## 3. Reduced scheme structure

For a number n\in{\mathbb{Z}}\_{>0} we write [n] for the set \{1,\dots,n\}.

Let us denote the components of the dimension vector \dim P by (a\_{i})\_{i\in Q\_{0}}.
A quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) sits inside the product of classical Grassmannians
\mathrm{Gr}\_{a\_{i}}(M\_{i}), i\in Q\_{0}. Using the standard Plücker embeddings of the Grassmann
varieties one arrives at the embedding

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)\subset\prod\_{i\in Q\_{0}}\mathrm{Gr}\_{a\_{i}}(M\_{i})% \subset\prod\_{i\in Q\_{0}}{\mathbb{P}}(\Lambda^{a\_{i}}(M\_{i})). |  |

We call the composition of these embedding the Plücker embedding for quiver Grassmannians.
Let \Delta^{(i)}\_{J}, J\in\binom{[d\_{i}]}{a\_{i}}, be the Plücker coordinates in the wedge space
\Lambda^{a\_{i}}(M\_{i}). We denote by the same symbols the homogeneous coordinates on the
projective space {\mathbb{P}}(\Lambda^{a\_{i}}(M\_{i})). Let {\mathcal{I}}(M) be the multi-homogeneous ideal in the
polynomial ring in all the variables \Delta^{(i)}\_{J} (for all i\in Q\_{0})
consisting of all multi-homogeneous polynomials vanishing on \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M). In order to give a (conjectural)
explicit description of {\mathcal{I}}(M) we introduce some notation.

Let us fix a basis v^{(i)}\_{p}, 1\leq p\leq d\_{i} in each component M\_{i} of the representation M.
For an arrow \alpha:i\to j, \alpha\in Q\_{1} let m\_{\alpha,p,q} be the matrix of the map M\_{\alpha}
written in the fixed bases. For a number p\in[d\_{i}] and a subset I\subset[d\_{i}] we write
\epsilon(p,I)=\#\{p^{\prime}\in I:\ p^{\prime}\leq p\}. The following relations are labeled by an arrow
\alpha:i\to j, a set I\subset[d\_{i}] of cardinality a\_{i}-1 and a set J\subset[d\_{j}] of cardinality [d\_{j}+1]:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.1) |  | R(\alpha,I,J)=\sum\_{\begin{subarray}{c}p\in[d\_{i}]\setminus I\\ q\in J\end{subarray}}(-1)^{\epsilon(p,I)+\epsilon(q,J)}m\_{\alpha,p,q}\Delta^{(% i)}\_{I\cup p}\Delta^{(j)}\_{J\setminus\{q\}}. |  |

It is shown in [LW19] that the relations above cut out \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) pointwise inside the product
of projectivized wedge powers. Similarly to relations (3.1) one gets a relation
R(\pi,I,J)
for any path \pi in Q with s(\pi)=i, t(\pi)=j and I\in\binom{[d\_{i}]}{a\_{i}-1},
J\in\binom{[d\_{j}]}{a\_{j}+1}:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.2) |  | R(\pi,I,J)=\sum\_{\begin{subarray}{c}p\in[d\_{i}]\setminus I\\ q\in J\end{subarray}}(-1)^{\epsilon(p,I)+\epsilon(q,J)}m\_{\pi,p,q}\Delta^{(i)}% \_{I\cup p}\Delta^{(j)}\_{J\setminus\{q\}}, |  |

with m\_{\pi,p,q} being matrix coefficients of the map M\_{\pi} (the composition of maps corresponding
to the arrows in \pi).

Recall the ideal {\mathcal{I}}(M) defining the reduced scheme structure of
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M).
We put forward the following conjecture:

###### Conjecture 3.1.

For any M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}
the ideal {\mathcal{I}}(M) is generated by the quadratic relations R(\pi,I,J) for all path \pi in Q and
all I\subset[d\_{s(\pi)}], \#I=a\_{s(\pi)-1} and J\subset[d\_{t(\pi)}], \#J=a\_{t(\pi)}+1.

In particular, the ideal generated by all the relations R(\pi,I,J) is saturated (with respect to
each group of Plücker variables \Delta^{(i)}\_{\bullet}) and is prime.
