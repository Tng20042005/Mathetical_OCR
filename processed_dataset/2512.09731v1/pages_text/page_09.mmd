We note that Conjecture 3.1 is far from being true for general quiver
Grassmannians.

## 4. Minimal dimension locus: irreducible Grassmannians

Recall that \dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0})=\dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(P\oplus Q)=\langle%
\dim P,\dim I\rangle and
both varieties are irreducible. Moreover, if a representation M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} degenerates
to P\oplus Q, then the quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is also irreducible and of the
same dimension.

Let’s denote by \Gamma\_{\bf d}(1) the subset of the degeneration poset \Gamma\_{\bf d} that consists of representations M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} whose Grassmanian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is irreducible of dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle.

Clearly, the lower ideal of \Gamma\_{\bf d} consisting of representations M that degenerate to P\oplus Q is contained in \Gamma\_{\bf d}(1). It turns out that they often coincide.

###### Example 4.1.

Let Q be the A\_{3} quiver of the form \bullet\rightarrow\bullet\leftarrow\bullet.
Let P and I be the direct sums of all projective (resp., injective) indecomposable
representations. Then the poset \Gamma\_{\bf d}(1) is visualized at Figure 2 below. Its single sink is exactly P\oplus Q.

P=P\_{1}\oplus P\_{2}\oplus P\_{3}, I=I\_{1}\oplus I\_{2}\oplus I\_{3}.

###### Conjecture 4.2.

There exists a representation M^{1} such that for a representation M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} the quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is irreducible of
dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle if and only if M degenerates to M^{1} (i.e.
M\in\Gamma\_{\bf d}(1) if and only if M^{0}\leq M\leq M^{1}).
If, furthermore, no component of either \dim P and \dim I is zero, M^{1}=P\oplus I.

The statement is proved in [CFFFR17, CFFFR20] for certain P and I for the equioriented type A quivers.
