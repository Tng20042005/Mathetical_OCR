###### Abstract.

Let P and I be a projective and an injective representations of a Dynkin quiver.
We consider quiver Grassmannians of subrepresentations of dimension \dim P inside
representations of dimension \dim P+\dim I. Based on extensive computer experiments, we formulate several conjectures about the
algebro-geometric properties of these quiver Grassmannians.

## 1. Introduction

Let Q be a Dynkin quiver with an arbitrary orientation. Let P and I be a projective
and an injective representations of Q. Our main objects of study are the quiver Grassmannians
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M), where M are \dim P+\dim I dimensional representations of Q.

Examples of such varieties naturally show up in various problems of algebraic geometry and representation theory
[CI20, CFFFR17, CFFFR20, CFR12].
In particular, classical flag varieties and their PBW degenerations can be realized in this way (see [CL15, Fe11, Fe12-1, FeFi13, FFR17]).
Our goal
is twofold: first, we develop the software which allows to perform calculations with the
quiver representations and quiver Grassmannians. Second, we use the software to check various
conjectural properties of our quiver Grassmannians. In what follows, following the suggestion
of Markus Reineke, we call quiver Grassmannians \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) with \dim M=\dim P+\dim I principal (or PrIncipal), where
Pr stands for projective and In for injective (we note that
one can not study all possible quiver Grassmannians, since every projective variety can be realized in this way [Re13, Ri18]).

Let Q\_{0} and Q\_{1} be the sets of vertices and arrows of Q. Let {\bf d}=\dim P+\dim I
be the dimension vector of a representations M as above and
let {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} be the representation space of Q of dimension {\bf d}. A point of the
universal quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}({\bf d}) consists of a point
M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} and a collection of (\dim P)\_{i}-dimensional subspaces of M\_{i}, i\in Q\_{0}
compatible with the maps of M. One has a natural projection map
\pi:\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}({\bf d})\to{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} whose fibers are the quiver Grassmannians.
Our first goal is to describe the reduced scheme structure of these fibers.

By definition, \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) are embedded into the product of classical Grassmann varieties
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P\_{i}}(M\_{i}), i\in Q\_{0} and hence admit the Plücker embedding into the product of
projectivized wedge powers.
One knows [LW19] that the quiver Grassmannians can be endowed with the scheme structure defined
