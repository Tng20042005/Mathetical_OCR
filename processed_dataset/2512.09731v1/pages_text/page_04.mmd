Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we fix the notation and recall the basic definitions from the theory of quivers.
In section 3 we formulate the conjectural description of the reduced scheme structure of the principal quiver Grassmannians.
In section 4 we formulate a conjecture on the locus of the irreducible principal quiver Grassmannians of the minimal possible dimension.
Sections 5 and 6 treat the case of (possibly reducible)
principal quiver Grassmannians of the minimal possible dimension.
In Section 7 we discuss the conjectural properties of the homogeneous coordinate rings.
Section 8 contains a brief description of the software used to compute examples supporting conjectures given
in the paper.

## 2. The setup

In this section we recall main definitions from the theory of quiver representations and quiver Grassmannians [ASS06, CB92, CR00, Schi14].

### 2.1. Generalities

We fix an algebraically closed field {\mathbf{k}} of characteristic zero.
Let Q be a Dynkin quiver with the set of vertices Q\_{0} and the set of arrows Q\_{1}.
For an arrow \alpha we write s(\alpha) for its source and t(\alpha) for its target. A representation of Q is a collection of vector spaces M\_{i}, i\in Q\_{0}
and a collection of linear maps M\_{\alpha}:M\_{s(\alpha)}\to M\_{t(\alpha)}.

The simple modules of Q are labeled by the vertices of Q. For i\in Q\_{0}
we denote by S\_{i} the simple 1-dimensional module supported at the vertex i.
There are finitely many iso-classes of indecomposable representations of Q;
these iso-classes are in bijection with positive roots of the simple Lie algebra
whose Dynkin diagram is Q. In what follows for a vertex i we denote by
P\_{i} the corresponding indecomposable projective module and by I\_{i} the
corresponding indecomposable injective module.
In particular, one has
the canonical embedding S\_{i}\to I\_{i} and the canonical projection P\_{i}\to S\_{i}.
We note that (P\_{i})\_{j}, i,j\in Q\_{0}
is non-zero if and only if there exists a path from i to j in Q and
(I\_{i})\_{j}, i,j\in Q\_{0}
is non-zero if and only if there exists a path from j to i.

For a dimension vector {\bf d}\in{\mathbb{Z}}\_{\geq 0}^{Q\_{0}} let {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} be the representation
space of Q of dimension {\bf d}:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}=\bigoplus\_{\alpha\in Q\_{1}}{\rm Hom}({\mathbf{k}}^{d\_{s(% \alpha)}},{\mathbf{k}}^{d\_{t(\alpha)}}). |  |

The space {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} is naturally acted upon (via the base change) by the group G\_{\bf d},
which is the product of the general linear groups GL\_{d\_{i}} for i\in Q\_{0}.
The orbits of this action parametrize the isomorphism classes of the {\bf d}-dimensional
representations of Q. We denote by {\rm Rep}(Q) the set of all representations
of the quiver Q.
