Clearly, if N\in\Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) and M\leq N, then M\in\Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) and hence
\Gamma\_{\bf d}(2)\subset\Gamma\_{\bf d} is a lower ideal, which contains a subideal \Gamma\_{\bf d}(1).

###### Example 5.1.

Let Q be the A\_{3} quiver of the form \bullet\rightarrow\bullet\leftarrow\bullet.
Let P and I be the direct sums of all projective (resp., injective) indecomposable
representations. Then the poset \Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) is visualized at Figure
3 below.

### 5.1. Type A

Let Q be a type A quiver with arbitrary orientation. We put forward the following conjecture.

###### Conjecture 5.2.

There exists a unique representation
M^{2}\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} such that \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is of dimension \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle
if and only if M degenerates to M^{2}. If M degenerates to M^{2}, then \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)
is equidimensional.

The conjecture above can be rephrased in the following way: the poset \Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) consists
of elements M such that M^{0}\leq M\leq M^{2} for certain element M^{2}\in\Gamma\_{\bf d}.

In general we expect that the following conjecture holds true.

###### Conjecture 5.3.

If \dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)=\langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle, then \dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)
is equidimensional.

Recall (see [CFFFR17]) that for the equioriented type A\_{n} quiver and P=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}P\_{i},
I=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}I\_{i}
the representation M^{2} as above does exist
and is isomorphic to

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.1) |  | M^{2}=P\oplus S\oplus I/S,\quad S=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}S\_{i}. |  |
