\langle{\bf a},\dim I\rangle\geq 0 for any dimension vector {\bf a}, which holds true because I is injective. Furthermore, if Q is of type A, then
it follows from [CEFR21, CEFF22]
that for any M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} the quiver Grassmannian
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is connected.
More precisely, one shows that all quiver Grassmannians for the type A quivers are connected. It is tempting to conjecture that
the same holds true for other Dynkin quivers as well: all the type D quiver Grassmannians \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) we’ve seen in our computations are indeed connected.

The following statements were proved in [CFR12].

* •

  \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0}) and \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(P\oplus Q) are irreducible,
* •

  \dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0})=\dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0})=\langle\dim P,%
  \dim I\rangle,
* •

  \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(P\oplus Q) is a flat degeneration of \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{0}),
* •

  if M degenerates to P\oplus Q, then \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is irreducible of dimension
  \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle.

### 2.3. Equioriented type A case

Let Q be the equioriented quiver of type A\_{n}. We denote the vertices of Q by 1,2,\dots,n with arrows
given by i\to i+1. The indecomposable representations are labeled by pairs i,j with
1\leq i\leq j\leq n; we denote the corresponding representation by U(i,j).
In particular, all non-trivial components of U(i,j) are one-dimensional and the
support of U(i,j) consists of vertices between i and j. One has S\_{i}=U(i,i),
P\_{i}=U(i,n), I\_{i}=U(1,i). The representation M^{0} is equal to U(1,n)^{\oplus n+1}.

Let us consider the special case P=\bigoplus\_{i=1}^{n}P\_{i}, I=\bigoplus\_{i=1}^{n}I\_{i}.
Then P is isomorphic (as a Q-module) to the path algebra and I to its dual.
One has (recall {\bf d}=\dim P+\dim I)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim A=(1,\dots,n),\ \dim A^{\*}=(n,\dots,1),\ {\bf d}=(n+1,\dots,n+1). |  |

The scalar product \langle\dim A,\dim A^{\*}\rangle is equal to n(n+1)/2. One observes
that \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim A}(M^{0}) is isomorphic to the classical full flag variety for the group
SL\_{n+1} (see e.g. [Fu97]) and \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim A}(P\oplus Q) is isomorphic to the PBW degenerate
flag variety for the group SL\_{n+1} (see e.g. [Fe11, Fe12-1, Fe23]).

We also introduce one more representation of dimension {\bf d}:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}=\bigoplus\_{i=1}^{n}U(i,n)\oplus\bigoplus\_{i=1}^{n}U(i,i)\oplus\bigoplus\_% {i=2}^{n}U(1,i-1). |  |

The following is proved in [CFFFR17] (see also [CFFFR20]).

* •

  \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim A}(M) is irreducible of dimension n(n+1)/2 if and only if M degenerates to M^{1},
* •

  \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim A}(M) is of dimension n(n+1)/2 if and only if M degenerates to M^{2}.

###### Remark 2.3.

The results of [CFFFR17] have to do with flat and flat irreducible loci of the universal quiver Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim A}({\bf d}).
