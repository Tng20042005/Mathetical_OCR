## 8. Software

Suggesting the above conjectures was made possible after extensive computer experiments with the quiver-representation library we’ve developed. It’s open source and available on github [Fed25].

The library’s main language is Python 3. It also relies on:

* •

  Macaulay 2 https://macaulay2.com/ to derive algebro-geometric properties of quiver Grassmannians from their equations.
* •

  GNU Parallel for batch computations.
* •

  Graphviz https://graphviz.org/ for visualization of \Gamma\_{\bf d}.

The library allows to perform a wide range of module-theoretic computations for quiver representations over the field of complex numbers or over any finite field, including:

* •

  Inferring indecomposable simple, projective and injective representations.
* •

  Computing direct sums, kernels and cokernels of morphisms, radicals and socles, projective covers and injective hulls.
* •

  Finding a basis of {\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M,N) for given M and N.
* •

  Enumerating indecomposables of A\_{n} and D\_{n}; creating a representation for a bag of intervals.

The library also has the full pipeline of checking the hypotheses mentioned in this paper: from enumerating all Plücker and incidence relations for a given quiver Grassmannian to constructing the graph \Gamma\_{\bf d} and to computing dimensions of irreducible components and Hilbert functions with Macaulay 2.

Despite the library supports module-theoretic computations over \mathbb{C}, we advise you to use it with caution. Floating-point computations are unavoidably imprecise; for example, a tiny computational error might make any matrix full-rank, which would lead to incorrect kernels, cokernels, etc.

Computations over finite fields lack this problem. So, in our experiments, the calculation of \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(\cdot,\cdot) was done over \mathbb{F}\_{107}.
The data needed to assess our hypotheses using the pipeline can be found in the examples folder: https://github.com/st-fedotov/quiver/tree/main/examples.

The pipeline tends to suffer from memory exhaustion due to combinatorial explosion when a quiver contains paths of length \geqslant 5 or if the multiplicities of indecomposable projectives or injectives in P\oplus I are greater than 1. This can be somewhat relieved by increasing the gc\_heap\_size parameter in the experimental config provided you have enough RAM. Still, the computations might take some time.

The bulk of our experiments were done on a Nebius’ virtual machine with 128 CPU and 512Gb RAM. Depending on the memory requirements, we used between 30 and 120 parallel computational streams.
