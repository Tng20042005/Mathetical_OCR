For example, for Q being the equioriented type A quiver the homogeneous components
{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0})
are identified with the dual irreducible highest weight {\mathfrak{sl}}\_{n} modules and {\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{1})
are identified with dual PBW degenerate representations [Fe23]. We put forward the following conjectures.

###### Conjecture 7.1.

Let P=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}, I=\bigoplus\_{j\in Q^{0}}I\_{j}. For any M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} and any {\bf m}\in{\mathbb{Z}}\_{\geq 0}^{Q\_{0}} one has the inequality
\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M)\geq\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0}). The equality
\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M)=\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0}) holds for all {\bf m} if and only if
\dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)=\langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle.

###### Remark 7.2.

Conjecture 7.1 does not hold for general P and I even for Q of type A.
More precisely, if one allows arbitrary multiplicities of indecomposable projecive
and injective modules in the decomposition of P and I, then the dimensions
\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M) may be different from \dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0}) even for M degenerating
to M^{1}.

###### Conjecture 7.3.

Let P=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}P\_{i}, I=\bigoplus\_{j\in Q^{0}}I\_{j}. Then for any M such that
\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M) is of minimal dimension, one has for all {\bf m}\in{\mathbb{Z}}\_{\geq 0}^{Q\_{0}}

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim H^{0}(\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P},\mathcal{O}({\bf m}))=\dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M),% \quad H^{>0}(\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P},\mathcal{O}({\bf m}))=0. |  |

###### Remark 7.4.

Conjecture 7.3 is not expected to hold for general P and I (although we
do not have a program computing the dimensions of the cohomology groups). The reason comes
from Remark 7.2: over a flat family the Euler characteristic of \mathcal{O}({\bf m})
is preserved, however the dimensions of the homogeneous components of the Plücker algebra
vary. This might be an indicator that the higher cohomology groups do not vanish in general.

###### Example 7.5.

Let Q be of the form 1\rightarrow 2\leftarrow 3. Then for u\_{i}=m\_{i}+1:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0})=\frac{1}{12}u\_{1}u\_{2}u\_{3}(3u\_{1}u\_{2}+3u\_{1}u\_{3% }+3u\_{2}u\_{3}+2u\_{2}^{2}+1). |  |

###### Example 7.6.

Let Q be of the form

1234

Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Pl}\_{\bf m}(M^{0})=\frac{1}{24}u\_{1}u\_{2}u\_{3}u\_{4}(3u\_{1}u\_{2}u\_{3}+% 3u\_{1}u\_{2}u\_{4}+3u\_{1}u\_{3}u\_{4}+3u\_{2}u\_{3}u\_{4}+\\ u\_{2}^{3}+2u\_{2}^{2}(u\_{1}+u\_{3}+u\_{4})+2u\_{2}+u\_{1}+u\_{3}+u\_{4}) |  |

(as above, u\_{i}=m\_{i}+1).
