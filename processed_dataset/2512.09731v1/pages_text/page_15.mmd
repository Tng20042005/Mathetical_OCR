  for every indecomposable non-injective X, \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P\oplus I,X)=\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X)

(the first equality follows from the general fact that
\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M,I\_{j})={\bf d}\_{j} for every M\in{\rm Rep}\_{\bf d}(Q), and the second holds true
since there are no homomorphisms from I to X).
Assume that the dimension vectors \dim P and \dim I never vanish. In this case we expect (see section 4) that M^{1}=P\oplus Q and hence we can characterize
\Gamma\_{\bf d}(1) as the set of all representations M such that, for every non-injective indecomposable representation X,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M,X)\leq\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X). |  |

It turns out that M^{2} allows for a similar description.

###### Conjecture 6.1.

Let P\oplus I contains every indecomposable projective and every indecomposable injective representation as a summand. Then a representation M lies in \Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) if and only if, for every non-injective indecomposable representation X,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M,X)\leq\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X)+1. |  |

###### Remark 6.2.

Dually, this can be formulated as: a representation M lies in \Gamma\_{\bf d}(2) if and only if, for every non-projective indecomposable representation X,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(X,M)\leq\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(X,I)+1/ |  |

This provides a general way of describing M^{2} for both A and D types.
For A type quivers, there exists a representation M^{2} satisfying, for all indecomposable non-injective representations X,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M^{2},X)=\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X)+1. |  |

For D type quivers such a representation M^{2} does not always exist. That’s why in some cases we have three sinks M^{2}(i) in \Gamma\_{\bf d}(2). However,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \max\_{i}\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M^{2}(i),X)=\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(P,X)+1 |  |

for all indecomposable non-injective X (assuming the conditions of Conjecture 6.1 are satisfied).
Note that this perfectly aligns with Conjecture 5.5. Indeed, if the above equation holds, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \max\_{i}\dim{\rm Hom}\_{Q}(M^{2}(i)\oplus P^{\prime}\oplus I^{\prime},X)=\dim{% \rm Hom}\_{Q}(P\oplus P^{\prime},X)+1. |  |

If some of P\_{j} or I\_{j} are missing in P\oplus I, then Conjecture 6.1 sometimes fails.
For example, let Q=D\_{4} with the arrow orientation illustrated below, P=P\_{1}\oplus P\_{3}\oplus P\_{4}, I=I\_{1}\oplus I\_{2}\oplus I\_{3}\oplus I\_{4}.
