We note that the right hand side can be rewritten as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Bigl{(}2U(1,1)+U(1,2)+2U(2,2)\Bigr{)}+\Bigl{(}2U(2,2)+U(2,3)+U(3,3)+U(2,4)+\\ U(4,4)+U(2,5)+U(3,5)+U(4,5)+2U(5,5)\Bigr{)}-2U(2,2), |  |

where the sums in brackets correspond to the representations M^{2} for the quivers
1\rightarrow 2 and 2\leftarrow 3\leftarrow 4\leftarrow 5 (with -2U(2,2) coming as gluing at vertex 2).

### 5.4. Type D

Let Q be the following D\_{4} quiver

Computer experiments support the following proposition.

###### Proposition 5.7.

Let Q the a quiver with vertices 1,2,3,4 and arrows 1\to 2, 2\to 3 and 2\to 4. Let P=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}P\_{i}, I=\bigoplus\_{i\in Q\_{0}}I\_{i}.
Then there exist three representations M^{2}(1), M^{2}(2), M^{2}(3) in {\rm Rep}\_{\bf d} such that
\dim\mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M)=\langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle if and only if M degenerates to one of
M^{2}(i), i=1,2,3. None of the representations M^{2}(1), M^{2}(2), M^{2}(3) degenerate one to another.

Let us provide more details. One has the following explicit formulas:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | {\bf d}=(5,5,4,4),\ \dim P=(1,2,3,3),\ \langle\dim P,\dim I\rangle=9. |  |

In order to write down the representations M^{2}(i) explicitly, we denote by V(x\_{1},x\_{2},x\_{3},x\_{4})
the indecomposable Q module of dimension (x\_{1},x\_{2},x\_{3},x\_{4}). Then one has

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}(1)=2V(1,0,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,0)\oplus V(0,1,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,1,0)\oplus% \\ 2V(0,0,1,0)\oplus V(0,1,0,1)\oplus 2V(0,0,0,1)\oplus V(1,1,1,1), |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}(2)=2V(1,0,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,0)\oplus V(0,1,0,0)\oplus V(0,1,1,0)\oplus% \\ 2V(0,0,1,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,1)\oplus 2V(0,0,0,1)\oplus V(1,1,1,1), |  |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{2}(3)=2V(1,0,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,0)\oplus V(1,1,1,0)\oplus V(0,1,1,0)\oplus% \\ 2V(0,0,1,0)\oplus V(1,1,0,1)\oplus V(0,1,0,1)\oplus 2V(0,0,0,1). |  |

All three quiver Grassmannians \mathrm{Gr}\_{\dim P}(M^{2}(i)) have 13 irreducible components of dimension 9.
