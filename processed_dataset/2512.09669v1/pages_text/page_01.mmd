# The geometric Sen morphism is the unique lift of the Kodaira–Spencer morphism

###### Abstract.

We show that the geometric Sen morphism of a de Rham torsor over a smooth rigid analytic variety over a p-adic field is the unique lift, along a natural map, of the Kodaira–Spencer morphism of the associated filtered torsor with integrable connection. This extends previous computations in the minuscule case, and implies that the geometric Sen morphism is the derivative of the lattice Hodge period map. The computation applies, in particular, to non-minuscule period domains generalizing local Shimura varieties, furnishing new examples of towers satisfying He’s stalkwise perfectoidness.

## 1. Introduction

This geometric Sen morphism of Pan [6] and Rodriguez Camargo [7] is a canonical twisted Higgs field associated to a p-adic Lie group torsor over a rigid analytic variety. Since its introduction, it has played an important role in p-adic geometry and its applications to automorphic forms [6, 5, RodriguezCamargo.LocallyAnalyticCompletedCohomology, 1, DospinescuRodriguezCamargo.JacquetLanglands]. For these applications, it is often necessary to have a description of the geometric Sen morphism in terms of more classical data. Such descriptions have been computed previously for infinite level global Shimura varieties [RodriguezCamargo.LocallyAnalyticCompletedCohomology] (building on the case of the modular curve in [6]), local Shimura varieties [DospinescuRodriguezCamargo.JacquetLanglands], and compact p-adic Lie group torsors over abelian varieties [BellovinCaiHowe.CharacterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties]. The main result of the present work (Theorem A) extends these prior computations by giving an explicit description of the geometric Sen morphism for any de Rham p-adic Lie group torsor in terms of the associated filtered analytic torsor with integrable connection. In particular, this result applies to the local systems coming from general smooth proper families of rigid analytic varieties where the Hodge cocharacter may no longer be minuscule (i.e., beyond the Shimura setting) and to non-miniscule rigid analytic crystalline period domains that generalize local Shimura varieties (Example 1.2.4).

Explicitly, Theorem A says that the geometric Sen morphism is the unique lift (along a natural map) of the Kodaira–Spencer morphism. This has a natural interpretation in terms of period maps (§1.2.6): the Kodaira–Spencer morphism is best interpreted as the derivative of the Hodge period map in the canonical flat direction, and
