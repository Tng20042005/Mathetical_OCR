This is evidently functorial in push-out. When G=\mathrm{GL}\_{n}, writing (\mathcal{V},\mathrm{Fil}^{\bullet},\nabla):=\omega(L^{n}),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \omega(\mathfrak{g})=\mathcal{E}nd(\mathcal{V})\textrm{ as a vector bundle.} |  |

The element \kappa\_{\mathcal{G}} can be computed in this case by choosing (locally) another connection \nabla^{\prime} on \mathcal{V} that does preserve the filtration and then taking \nabla-\nabla^{\prime} as an element of

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Omega^{1}\_{S}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}\_{S}}\mathcal{E}nd(V) |  |

and then passing to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \Omega^{1}\_{S}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}\_{S}}(\mathcal{E}nd(V)/\mathrm{Fil}^{0}% \mathcal{E}ndV) |  |

to get an element that is independent of the choice of \nabla^{\prime} (so that, in particular, the local choices all glue to a global section). It follows that (\mathcal{V},\mathrm{Fil}^{\bullet},\nabla) satisfies Griffiths transversality if and only if its Kodaira-Spencer morphism lies in \mathrm{gr}^{-1}\left(\mathcal{E}ndV\right). By the functoriality of the construction, we conclude that in general a filtered G-bundle with integrable connection \omega satisfies Griffiths transversality if and only if \kappa\_{\mathcal{G}} factors through \mathrm{gr}^{-1}(\omega(\mathfrak{g})).

### 2.4. de Rham local systems

Suppose now that L is a p-adic field. The results of [8, §6] show that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{M}:(\mathcal{V},\mathrm{Fil}^{\bullet},\nabla)\rightarrow\mathrm{Fil}^% {0}(\mathcal{V}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{O}\mathbb{B}\_{\mathrm{dR}})^{% \nabla=0} |  |

is a fully faithful exact tensor functor from filtered vector bundles with integrable connection on S satisfying Griffiths transversality to \mathbb{B}^{+}\_{\mathrm{dR}}-local systems on S\_{\mathrm{pro\acute{e}t}}. Recall that a \underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}-local system \mathbb{L} is de Rham if \mathbb{L}\otimes\_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\mathbb{B}^{+}\_{\mathrm{dR}}=%
\mathbb{M}(\mathcal{V},\mathrm{Fil}^{\bullet},\nabla), in which case \mathbb{L}\otimes\_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\mathcal{O}\mathbb{B}\_{\mathrm{%
dR}}=\mathcal{V}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}}\mathcal{O}\mathbb{B}\_{\mathrm{dR}}, compatibly with the natural filtrations and connections on both sides.

## 3. Proof of Theorem A

In this section we prove Theorem A. Thus let L be a p-adic field, let S/L be a smooth rigid analytic variety, let G/\mathbb{Q}\_{p} be a connected linear algebraic group, and let K\leq G(\mathbb{Q}\_{p}) be an open subgroup. We fix a de Rham K-torsor \tilde{S}/S, and write \tilde{S}\_{\mathrm{dR}} for the associated filtered G-torsor with integrable connection. We write \tilde{\mathfrak{g}}=\tilde{S}\times^{K}\underline{\mathfrak{g}}, and \tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\_{\mathrm{dR}}=\tilde{S}\_{\mathrm{dR}}\times^{G}%
\operatorname{Lie}G, which is the filtered vector bundle (with integrable connection that we will not use) associated to the de Rham local system \tilde{\mathfrak{g}} as in §2.4. On \tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\otimes\hat{\mathcal{O}} we have the Hodge-Tate filtration, written \mathrm{Fil}^{\bullet}\_{\mathrm{HT}}, and its associated graded \mathrm{gr}^{\bullet}\_{\mathrm{HT}}. On \mathfrak{g}\_{\mathrm{dR}} we have the Hodge filtration, written \mathrm{Fil}^{\bullet}\_{\mathrm{Hdg}}, and its associated graded \mathrm{gr}^{\bullet}\_{\mathrm{Hdg}}. The geometric Sen morphism associated to \tilde{S} by [7, Theorem 1.0.4] is written, as in the introduction, as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \kappa\_{\tilde{S}}:T\_{S/C}\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}\rightarrow% \tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\otimes\_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}}(-1), |  |

and the Kodaira-Spencer morphism associated to \tilde{S}\_{\mathrm{dR}} (see §2.2) is written

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \kappa\_{\tilde{S}\_{\mathrm{dR}}}:T\_{S/C}\rightarrow\mathrm{gr}^{-1}\_{\mathrm{% Hdg}}(\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\_{\mathrm{dR}}). |  |

We have a natural map

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.0.0.1) |  | q\_{\tilde{S}}:\left(\mathrm{Fil}^{1}\_{\mathrm{HT}}(\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\otimes% \_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}})\right)(-1)\twoheadrightarrow% \left(\mathrm{gr}^{1}\_{\mathrm{HT}}(\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\otimes\_{\underline{% \mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}})\right)(-1)=\left(\mathrm{gr}^{-1}\_{\mathrm{% Hdg}}(\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\_{\mathrm{dR}})\right)\otimes\_{\mathcal{O}}\hat{% \mathcal{O}}, |  |

where the equality is by the Hodge-Tate comparison. We need to show that \kappa\_{\tilde{S}} factors through \left(\mathrm{Fil}^{1}\_{\mathrm{HT}}(\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\otimes\_{\underline{%
\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}})\right)(-1), that \kappa\_{\tilde{S}\_{\mathrm{dR}}}=q\_{\tilde{S}}\circ\kappa\_{\tilde{S}}, and that \kappa\_{\tilde{S}} is the unique such lift.

### 3.1. Uniqueness of the lift

Consider the short exact sequence on S\_{\mathrm{pro\acute{e}t}}

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 0\rightarrow\mathrm{Fil}^{2}\_{\mathrm{HT}}(\tilde{\mathfrak{g}}\otimes\_{% \underline{\mathbb{Q}\_{p}}}\hat{\mathcal{O}})\rightarrow\mathrm{Fil}^{1}\_{% \mathrm{HT}}(\tilde{\mathf
