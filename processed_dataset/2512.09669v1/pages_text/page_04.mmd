racterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties, Theorem 1.10] (but the argument of [BellovinCaiHowe.CharacterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties] also gives the result also for abelian varieties over C that are not defined over a p-adic subfield!). Note that [BellovinCaiHowe.CharacterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties, Theorem 1.10] also computes the geometric Sen morphism for the analogous cover of a p-divisible rigid analytic group; Theorem A can also be used to recover this computation for a p-divisible rigid analytic group G defined over L — here, the relevant comparison is between the Tate and Dieudonné modules of the universal extension of \mathbb{Q}\_{p}/\mathbb{Z}\_{p} by G over G constructed as in [3, §4].

###### Example 1.2.2.

A direct summand of the relative p-adic cohomology local system of a smooth proper family is a de Rham local system. If the Hodge numbers for a member of this family are not concentrated in two neighboring indices then the Hodge cocharacter is non-minuscule and the computation of the geometric Sen morphism in Theorem A is new (though in some cases can be recovered from previous computations for global and local Shimura varieties if the Hodge cocharacter is minuscule as a cocharacter of the Mumford-Tate group or local Mumford-Tate group). Explicit examples can be found, e.g., by taking the middle cohomology of a family of hypersurfaces of large degree in \mathbb{P}^{n}, n\geq 3.

###### Example 1.2.3.

Typically, the Hodge-Tate cocharacter of a de Rham p-adic Galois representation will not be minuscule even as a cocharacter of the Zariski closure of its image. In particular, when the closure is reductive, any de Rham torsor whose specialization at a classical point recovers such a representation will have non-minuscule Hodge cocharacter and thus cannot be constructed by pullback from a canonical torsor on a local or global Shimura variety. Thus the computation of Theorem A is completely new in these cases.

###### Example 1.2.4.

For G/\mathbb{Q}\_{p} a connected linear algebraic group, we write \mathrm{Fl}\_{G} for the flag variety parameterizing filtrations on the trivial G-torsor. There is a natural Bialynicki-Birula map \mathrm{Gr}\_{G}^{\mathrm{split}}\rightarrow\mathrm{Fl}\_{G}^{\diamond}, where the domain \mathrm{Gr}\_{G}^{\mathrm{split}} is the disjoint union of the Schubert cells in the B^{+}\_{\mathrm{dR}}-affine Grassmannian \mathrm{Gr}\_{G} parameterizing lattices on the trivial G(\mathbb{B}^{+}\_{\mathrm{dR}})-torsor.

Let L be a p-adic field with residue field \kappa and let L\_{0}=W(\kappa)[1/p]. We base change all of the spaces in question to L. Then, by [2, Theorem 5.0.4-(4)], for S/L a smooth rigid analytic variety, \operatorname{Hom}\_{\mathrm{Spd}L}(S^{\diamond},\mathrm{Gr}\_{G,L}^{\mathrm{%
split}}) is canonically identified with the set of maps of rigid analytic varieties f:S\rightarrow\mathrm{Fl}\_{G} satisfying Griffiths transversality (i.e. such that df factors through f^{\*}\mathrm{gr}^{-1}\_{\mathrm{univ}}(\mathfrak{g}\otimes\mathcal{O}\_{\mathrm{%
Fl}\_{G}})\subseteq f^{\*}T\_{\mathrm{Fl}\_{G}}=f^{\*}(\mathfrak{g}\otimes\mathcal{%
O}\_{\mathrm{Fl}\_{G}}/\mathrm{Fil}^{0}\_{\mathrm{univ}}(\mathfrak{g}\otimes%
\mathcal{O}\_{\mathrm{Fl}\_{G}}))).

Now, for b\in G(L\_{0}), we have an open b-admissible locus \mathrm{Gr}\_{G}^{\mathrm{split},b-\mathrm{adm}}\subseteq\mathrm{Gr}\_{G}^{%
\mathrm{split}}, with a canonical G(\mathbb{Q}\_{p})-torsor \mathbb{U} over it (this is the universal flat crystalline G(\mathbb{Q}\_{p})-torsor for the G-isocrystal b). In particular, for any map S\rightarrow\mathrm{Fl}\_{G} atisfying Griffiths transversality, we have the associated lift \tilde{f}:S\rightarrow\mathrm{Gr}\_{G,L}^{\mathrm{split}} and an open subset S^{b-\mathrm{adm}}:=\tilde{f}^{-1}(\mathrm{Gr}\_{G}^{\mathrm{split},b-\mathrm{%
adm}}). Over S^{b-\mathrm{adm}} we have the de Rham G(\mathbb{Q}\_{p})-torsor f^{\*}\mathbb{U}, and by construction the associated Kodaira-Spencer morphism is identified with df; Theorem A then pins down its geometric Sen morphism. In particular, if we restrict to a component \mathrm{Fl}\_{[\mu]} of \mathrm{Fl}\_{G} corresponding to a geometric conjugacy class of miniscule cocharacters [\mu], then we can take S=\mathrm{Fl}\_{[\mu]}, and in this case we recover the computation of the geometric Sen morphism in the case of local Shimura varieties. However, just as in complex Hodge theory, there are also many smooth rigid analytic subvarieties living inside of non-minuscule components but still satisfying Griffiths transversality, and these provide interesting non-miniscule rigid analytic period domains where our computation of the geometric Sen morphism applies and is new.

#### 1.2.5. Perfectoidness

For S/C a smooth rigid analytic variety, K a p-adic Lie group, and \tilde{S}/S a pro-étale K-torsor, [7, Conjecture 3.3.5] predicts that \tilde{S}\_{C} is perfectoid if the geometric Sen morphism \kappa\_{\tilde{S}} is injective at every geometric point. This conjecture is known if S is a semi-abelian variety and K is compact by [BellovinCaiHowe.CharacterizingPerfectoidCoversOfAbelianVarieties, Theorem 1.10], and there is also a large pile of evidence coming from the cases where infinite level local or global Shimura varieties are known to be perfectoid (starting with the Hodge-type case established in [9]).

When S and \tilde{S}/S both arise via base change from the p-adic field L, Tongmu He [1, Theorem 1.17] has established a stalkwise perfectoidness under the same injectivity hypothesies that is sufficient for many applications to cohomological vanishing. Theorem A implies that if the torsor is de Rham and the Kodaira-Spencer morphism is injective at every geometric point then t
