The PDF of TGEV model depends on (\mu,\sigma,\gamma,\lambda)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\_{+}\times\mathbb{R}%
\times[-1,1]. The support of the model is (\mu-\sigma/\gamma,\infty), if \gamma>0, or (-\infty,\mu-\sigma/\gamma), if \gamma<0, or \mathbb{R}, if \gamma=0.
We are interested in the case where TGEV is used to model positive data. In this case, we consider \gamma>0 and \mu=\sigma/\gamma. It follows from (2) and Eq.(4) in [2] that the PDF of TGEV distribution is

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle f\_{2}(y;\sigma,\gamma,\lambda) | \displaystyle= | \displaystyle c\_{0}g(y;(0,\gamma/\sigma,1,0,-1/\gamma,-1-1/\gamma))+c\_{1}g(y;(% 0,2^{-\gamma}\frac{\gamma}{\sigma},1,0,-1/\gamma,-1-1/\gamma)), |  |

where c\_{0} and c\_{1} are constants depending only on (\sigma,\gamma,\lambda) and c\_{0}+c\_{1}=1.

## 3 Some properties of the new class of distributions

In this section, we study several probabilistic properties of the density g(y;\bm{\theta}) given in (2).

### 3.1 Characteristic function, Mellin transform and moments

Let Y be a random variable with PDF g(\cdot;\bm{\theta}).
The characteristic function of Y, denoted by \varphi(t), is given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi(t)=\mathbb{E}\_{\bm{\theta}}\left[e^{itY}\right]=\frac{\mathbb{H}(% \theta\_{1}-it,\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6})}{\mathbb% {H}(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6})},% \leavevmode\nobreak\ \leavevmode\nobreak\ t\in\mathbb{R}. |  |

where \mathbb{E}\_{\bm{\theta}}(\cdot) denotes the expected value under the density g(\cdot;\bm{\theta}).

The Mellin transform111We may refer to [25] for further details on the properties of Mellin transforms in the context of the algebra of random variables. is important in determining the distributions of the products and quotients of independent random variables. Furthermore, in the case of positive random variables, the Mellin transform of the PDF gives us the moments of the random variable.
The Mellin transform of g(\cdot;\bm{\theta}) is given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \{\mathcal{M}g\}(s)=\int\_{0}^{\infty}y^{s-1}g(y;\bm{\theta}){\rm d}y=\frac{% \mathbb{H}(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6}+s% -1)}{\mathbb{H}(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_% {6})}. |  |

Then, real moments of Y of order r are given by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\mathbb{E}\_{\bm{\theta}}[Y^{r}]=\{\mathcal{M}g\}(r+1)=\frac{% \mathbb{H}(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6}+r% )}{\mathbb{H}(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6% })}. |  | (23) |

### 3.2 Entropy

Let Y be a random variable with PDF g(\cdot;\bm{\theta}). We define the differential entropy of Y by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | h(Y):=-\int\_{0}^{\infty}g(y;\bm{\theta})\log g(y;\bm{\theta}){\rm d}y=-\mathbb% {E}\_{\bm{\theta}}[\log g(Y;\bm{\theta})], |  | (24) |

where \mathbb{E}\_{\bm{\theta}}(\cdot) denotes the expected value under the density g(\cdot;\bm{\theta}). Substituting (2) in (24), we obtain
