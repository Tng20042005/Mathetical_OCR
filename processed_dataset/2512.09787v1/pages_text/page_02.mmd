ribution function (CDF). The stochastic representation provides an alternative way to generate random variables, which was not addressed in the previous work. A more in-depth study of the modality and shapes, which are essential for a proper understanding of the model’s characteristics, is also needed to be described, in addition to other important features such as moments and characteristic function. These aspects are fundamental not only for ensuring the internal consistency of the proposed probability model but also for enabling its practical use in statistical inference and simulation-based analysis. Without a complete characterization, including the CDF, stochastic representation, and moment properties, the applicability of the distribution to real-world problems remains limited. Therefore, this work aims to bridge this gap by providing both the theoretical development and the computational tools required for its implementation.

The aim of this paper is to study statistical properties of (1), such as particular cases, modality, shapes, finite mixtures, characteristic function, Mellin transform, moments, and entropy. Inferential properties are also addressed through maximum likelihood estimators and conditions for g(y;\bm{\theta}) to belong to the exponential family are derived. A second estimator is also proposed, based on the difference between the empirical distribution function and the theoretical cumulative distribution function.

In our study, we assess two estimators through real data modeling. We examine three distinct datasets to gain insights into their performance.
The first dataset focuses on the minimum monthly water flows (measured in cubic meters per second, m³/s) of the Piracicaba River, situated in São Paulo state, Brazil.
The second dataset investigates the strength of carbon fibers under stress. These fibers were tested to understand their behavior when subjected to tension.
Finally, we analyze a dataset that captures the failure times of various machine parts. This information is important for maintenance and reliability considerations.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the model is presented and we study modality, shapes, and particular cases.
In Section 3, properties of the new class of distributions are derived. Two classes of estimators are presented in Section 4, while Section 5 presents real data applications.

## 2 A class of continuous distributions with positive support

Let \Theta\subset\mathbb{R}^{6} be a parameter space.
For a random variable Y we define the PDF

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | g(y;\bm{\theta})=\frac{1}{c(\bm{\theta})}y^{\theta\_{6}}\exp\left(-\theta\_{1}y-% (\theta\_{2}y^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}}\right),\leavevmode\nobreak% \ \leavevmode\nobreak\ y>0, |  | (2) |

where \bm{\theta}=(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6}%
)\in\Theta is a parameter vector such that \theta\_{1}\geq 0, \theta\_{2}\geq 0 (\theta\_{1} and \theta\_{2} cannot be zero simultaneously), \theta\_{4}\geq 0 and \theta\_{3},\theta\_{5}\in\mathbb{R}.
\theta\_{6}>-1 when \theta\_{1}\neq 0 or \theta\_{1}=0 and {\rm sign}(\theta\_{3})={\rm sign}(\theta\_{5}), \theta\_{6}<-1 when \theta\_{1}=0 and {\rm sign}(\theta\_{3})\neq{\rm sign}(\theta\_{5}). These are general restrictions which could be further manipulated when \theta\_{5}\in\mathbb{Z}. In particular, an integer valued \theta\_{5} allows one to relax the constraints on \theta\_{1}, \theta\_{2} and \theta\_{4}, extending their possible domains to negative values. This should, on the other hand, be assessed in a case by case basis. In Subsection 2.1, for example, the case when \theta\_{5}\in\mathbb{N} is discussed. In that case, if \theta\_{5} is even, then \theta\_{1}>0 and \theta\_{2},\theta\_{4}\in\mathbb{R}. On the other hand, if \theta\_{5} is odd, then three possible scenarios arise: if \theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}<1, then \theta\_{2}>0 and \theta\_{1}\in\mathbb{R}; if \theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}=1, then (\theta\_{1}+\theta\_{2}^{\theta\_{5}})>0; finally, if \theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}<1, then \theta\_{1}>0 and \theta\_{2}\in\mathbb{R}.
The function c({\bm{\theta}}) appearing in the definition of g is a normalizing factor written as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | c(\bm{\theta})=\mathbb{H}(\bm{\theta}):=\mathbb{H}(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},% \theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6})=\int\_{0}^{\infty}y^{\theta\_{6}}% \exp\left(-\theta\_{1}y-(\theta\_{2}y^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}}% \right){\rm d}y. |  | (3) |

We recall that extreme value \mathbb{H}-function was first defined in [22] who also proposed the PDF (2). Statistical and mathematical properties of g(y;\bm{\theta}) are addressed in this paper.

Note that, in general, the model (2) is not (globally) identifiable. For example, for \bm{\theta}=(\theta,0,0,0,1,0)\neq\bm{\theta}^{\prime}=(0,\theta,1,0,1,0), we have g(y;\bm{\theta})=g(y;\bm{\theta}^{\prime}). By globally identifiable, we mean that the mapping \Theta\ni\bm{\theta}\mapsto g(y;\bm{\theta}) is one-to-one, for all y>0, onto the entire parameter space \Theta. It is often possible to achieve identifiability in a parametric model that fails to satisfy this property by introducing specific technical constraints, such as those discussed in Ref. [23], thereby facilitating meaningful inference.

The CDF corresponding to PDF g(y;\bm{\theta}) is given by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | G(x)=G(x;\bm{\theta}):=\frac{1}{c(\bm{\theta})}\mathbb{H}(x;\bm{\theta})=\frac% {\mathbb{H}(x;\bm{\theta})}{\mathbb{H}(\bm{\theta})},\leavevmode\nobreak\ % \leavevmode\nobreak\ x>0, |  | (4) |

where \mathbb{H}(x;\bm{\theta})=\int\_{0}^{x}y^{\theta\_{6}}\exp\left(-\theta\_{1}y-(%
\theta\_{2}y^{\theta}\_{3}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}}\right){\rm d}y is the incomplete extreme value \mathbb{H}-function (for more details see Subsection 2.1). Figure 1 presents the behavior the PDFs of this random variable for some arbitrary values of its parameters.

###### Remark 2.1.

Note that the PDF (2) of g(y;\bm{\theta}) defines a weighted gamma distribution by considering the gamma distribution with shape parameter \theta\_{6}+1 and rate parameter \theta\_{1} and the weight function w(y)=\exp(-(\theta\_{2}y^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}}), y>0.

### 2.1 The incomplete extreme value \mathbb{H}-function

Consider the extreme value \mathbb{H}-function in (3). Define

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | h\_{y}(\bm{\theta}):=y^{\theta\_{6}}\exp\left(-\theta\_{1}y-(\theta\_{2}y^{\theta\_% {3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}}\right),\leavevmode\nobreak\ y>0. |  |

Then, the incomplete extreme value \mathbb{H}-function is defined by
