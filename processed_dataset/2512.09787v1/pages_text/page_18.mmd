The descriptive statistics (Table 2) and boxplots (Figure 3) show that the distributions of data X and Z are right-skewed. This supports the initial choice of using the Fréchet, Weibull, and Gamma models for each case, respectively.

We aim to verify that the newly developed model in this study not only generalizes the existing models mentioned earlier but also provides a better fit to the data.
Figure 4 shows the fit of distributions to dataset, meanwhile the estimated parameters of the previous modeling reported by [19, 29] were (\hat{\alpha},\hat{\sigma}) equal to (1.564, 13.76) for X (Fréchet model), (5.505, 2.651) for Y (Weibull model) and (0.8274, 560.35) for Z (Gamma model).
