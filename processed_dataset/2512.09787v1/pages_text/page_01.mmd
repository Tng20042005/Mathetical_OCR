###### Abstract

In order to better fit real-world datasets, studying asymmetric distribution is of great interest.
In this work, we derive several mathematical properties of a general class of asymmetric distributions with positive support which shows up as a unified framework for Extreme Value Theory asymptotic results.
The new model generalizes some well-known distribution models such as Generalized Gamma, Inverse Gamma, Weibull, Fréchet, Half-normal, Modified half-normal, Rayleigh, and Erlang.
To highlight the applicability of our results, the performance of the analytical models is evaluated through real-life dataset modeling.

Keywords: Generalized classes of distributions, Skewed probability distributions, Extreme value \mathbb{H}-function, Maximum likelihood estimator, Statistical modeling of asymmetric data.

## 1 Introduction

Asymmetric distributions are common across various fields, such as epidemiology and finance, where they help model phenomena like disease spread and risk assessment [8]. In finance, heavy-tailed distributions are the most suitable tool for predicting stock performance and optimizing portfolios by quantifying probabilities and managing risk [21, 20, 16]. Our focus, however, is to study a new class of distributions with positive support that generalizes many existing asymmetric models.

Nadarajah [12] studied problems involving stress-strength reliability (SSR) for extreme value distributions. He wrote the probability P(X<Y) in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions when X and Y were independent random variables with Weibull, Fréchet, or Gumbel distribution and relied on severe parameter restrictions to get analytical results.

Inspired by the work of [12], [22] observed that the parameter restrictions could be relaxed if a new class of special functions was introduced, called extreme value \mathbb{H}-function. Later, [14, 15, 16] showed that \mathbb{H}-functions could also be used to describe SSR for the distributions of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, transmuted GEV and p-max stable laws families.

Departing from mathematical properties of \mathbb{H}-functions studied in [22], a new class of probability density function (PDF) with positive support was introduced
in [22]. However, the mathematical and statistical properties and the applications of this model require a more in-depth study, which will be provided in this work. The PDF is given by:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | g(y;\bm{\theta})=\frac{1}{c(\bm{\theta})}y^{\theta\_{6}}\exp\left(-\theta\_{1}y-% (\theta\_{2}y^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}}\right),\leavevmode\nobreak% \ \leavevmode\nobreak\ y>0, |  | (1) |

where \bm{\theta}=(\theta\_{1},\theta\_{2},\theta\_{3},\theta\_{4},\theta\_{5},\theta\_{6}) and c(\bm{\theta}) is a normalizing constant (more details about the parameter space for \bm{\theta} will be given in the following sections).
This new class of PDFs generalizes several well-known models in the literature, such as exponential, Gamma, Generalized Gamma [26], Inverse Gaussian [9], Inverse Generalized Gamma [18], Weibull [9], Fréchet, Half-normal, Modified half-normal [28], Rayleigh [9], Maxwell–Boltzmann [9] and Erlang [9] distributions, among others.

Although [22] introduced the PDF (1), they focused only on the mathematical properties of the extreme value \mathbb{H}-function, thus a complete characterization of the model needs to be discussed to fully expose its potential. For example, a topic that needs to be studied is the description of the incomplete extreme value \mathbb{H}-function, which is necessary for presenting the model’s cumulative dist
