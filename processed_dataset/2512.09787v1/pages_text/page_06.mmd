|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle P(W\_{n}=n)={(-1)^{n}\over n!}\,\dfrac{\theta\_{6}\Gamma(\theta\_{6% })E[(\theta\_{2}Z^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{n\theta\_{5}}]}{c(\bm{\theta})\theta% \_{1}^{\theta\_{6}+1}},\quad n=0,1,\ldots. |  | (15) |

Indeed, by using the law of total probability and by (13) (for y>0),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle P(Y\leq y) | \displaystyle=\sum\_{k=0}^{\infty}P(Y\leq y|W\_{k}=k)P(W\_{k}=k) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\sum\_{k=0}^{\infty}P(X\_{k}\leq y|W\_{k}=k)P(W\_{k}=k) |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\sum\_{k=0}^{\infty}F\_{X\_{k}}(y)P(W\_{k}=k), |  | (16) |

where in the last line the independence of X\_{n} and W\_{n} was used. By employing (14) and (15) in (2.3) the CDF of Y is written as (for y>0)

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle P(Y\leq y) | \displaystyle=\dfrac{1}{c(\bm{\theta})}\sum\_{k=0}^{\infty}{(-1)^{k}\over k!}\,% E[(\theta\_{2}Z^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{k\theta\_{5}}{1}\_{\{Z\leq y\}}],\quad Z% \sim{\rm Gamma(\theta\_{6}+1,\theta\_{1})}, |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\dfrac{\theta\_{6}\Gamma(\theta\_{6})}{c(\bm{\theta})\theta\_{1}^{% \theta\_{6}+1}}\,E\left[\exp\{-(\theta\_{2}Z^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5% }}\}{1}\_{\{Z\leq y\}}\right] |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\dfrac{1}{c(\bm{\theta})}\,\int\_{0}^{y}s^{\theta\_{6}}\exp\left(-% \theta\_{1}s-(\theta\_{2}s^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}}\right){\rm d}s=% \dfrac{\mathbb{H}(y;\bm{\theta})}{\mathbb{H}(\bm{\theta})}=G(y), |  |

where in the last identity we have used (4).
We have thus completed the proof of (13).

###### Remark 2.2.

It is clear that when \theta\_{5}\in\mathbb{N} the expectations in (14) and (15) become simple closed-forms depending on the CDF of the gamma distribution.

### 2.4 Modality and shapes

A simple calculation shows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\frac{d}{dy}g(y;\bm{\theta})=\frac{g(y;\bm{\theta})}{c(\bm{\theta% })y}\left[\theta\_{6}-\theta\_{1}y-\theta\_{2}\theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}(\theta\_{2}y^{% \theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}-1}y^{\theta\_{3}}\right]=0 |  |

iff

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\theta\_{6}-\theta\_{1}y=\theta\_{2}\theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}(\theta\_{2}y% ^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}-1}y^{\theta\_{3}}. |  | (17) |

Therefore, every critical point y of g is a positive solution of the above equation.

In what follows we analyze the number of roots of Equation (17) in the less trivial cases.

1. 1.

   If [\theta\_{2}=0 or \theta\_{3}=0 or \theta\_{5}=0], \theta\_{1}>0 and \theta\_{6}>0 then y=\theta\_{6}/\theta\_{1} is the unique solution of (17).
2. 2.

   If -1<\theta\_{6}\leq 0, [\theta\_{1}\neq 0 or \theta\_{1}=0] and {\rm sign}(\theta\_{3})={\rm sign}(\theta\_{5}) then it is clear that (17) has no solution.
3. 3.

   If \theta\_{6}<-1, \theta\_{1}=0, {\rm sign}(\theta\_{3})\neq{\rm sign}(\theta\_{5}) and \theta\_{2},\theta\_{4}>0 then (17) it is equivalent to

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \displaystyle\frac{\theta\_{6}}{\theta\_{2}\theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}}=(\theta\_{2}z+% \theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}-1}z,\quad z=y^{\theta\_{3}}. |  | (18) |

   First, let us assume that \theta\_{5}>0. In this case,
   the function z\mapsto r(z)=(\theta\_{2}z+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}-1}z is increasing, and hence, (18) has a unique positive solution.
   On the other hand, assume that \theta\_{5}<0.
   In this case, a routine calculation shows that z\mapsto r(z) is unimodal, with maximum point
   z\_{0}=-\theta\_{4}/(\theta\_{2}\theta\_{5}) and maximum value
