   |  | \displaystyle r(z\_{0})=\left(\frac{1}{-\theta\_{5}}+1\right)^{\theta\_{5}-1}% \frac{\theta\_{4}^{\theta\_{5}}}{\theta\_{2}(-\theta\_{5})}. |  |

   Imposing the condition
   \left({1/(-\theta\_{5})}+1\right)^{\theta\_{5}-1}\theta\_{4}^{\theta\_{5}}>{-%
   \theta\_{6}/\theta\_{3}}
   we have r(z\_{0})>\theta\_{6}/(\theta\_{2}\theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}), and therefore (18) has two positive solutions. Which implies that (17) also has two positive solutions.
   On the other hand, under condition
   \left({1/(-\theta\_{5})}+1\right)^{\theta\_{5}-1}\theta\_{4}^{\theta\_{5}}<{-%
   \theta\_{6}/\theta\_{3}}
   we have r(z\_{0})<\theta\_{6}/(\theta\_{2}\theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}), and therefore (18) has no positive solutions. Which implies that (17) also has no positive solutions.

   If \theta\_{6}>0, [\theta\_{1}\neq 0 or \theta\_{1}=0] and {\rm sign}(\theta\_{3})={\rm sign}(\theta\_{5}) then the function y\mapsto s(y)=(\theta\_{2}y^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}-1}y^{\theta\_{3}} is increasing when \theta\_{5}>0 and is unimodal when \theta\_{5}<0. It is clear that in the case \theta\_{5}>0 the equation (17) has a unique positive root. Following the steps in the previous item, it can be proven that, when \theta\_{5}<0 the equation (17) has two or no positive solutions.

Since \lim\_{y\to\infty}g(y;\bm{\theta})=0, the number of roots deduced in Items 1-4 above show that the density g in (2) has strictly decreasing, unimodal and decreasing-increasing-decreasing forms.

It is also possible to build a general solution to (17) where one of the roots can be expressed by using Lagrange’s Inversion Theorem [10]. In that case, let y be defined as the following function of constant \chi, function \phi, and a parameter \delta:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | y=\chi+\delta\phi(y) |  | (19) |

then any function \zeta(y) is expressed as the following power series in \delta:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \zeta(y)=\zeta(\chi)+\sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\delta^{n}}{n!}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx% ^{n-1}}\left\{\frac{d\zeta(x)}{dx}\phi^{n}(x)\right\}\bigg{\rvert}\_{x=\chi}, |  | (20) |

where suitable restrictions apply to make sure the series above converges. This way, equation (17) can be rearranged as:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | y=\frac{\theta\_{6}}{\theta\_{1}}-\frac{\theta\_{2}\theta\_{3}\theta\_{5}}{\theta\_{% 1}}(\theta\_{2}y^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}-1}y^{\theta\_{3}}. |  | (21) |

The direct comparison of (19), (20) and (21) reveals that, for \zeta(y)=y:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle y | \displaystyle= | \displaystyle\frac{\theta\_{6}}{\theta\_{1}}+\sum\_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}% \theta\_{2}^{n}\theta\_{3}^{n}\theta\_{5}^{n}}{\theta\_{1}^{n}n!}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dx% ^{n-1}}\left\{(\theta\_{2}x^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{\theta\_{5}n-n}x^{\theta\_{% 3}n}\right\}\bigg{\rvert}\_{x=\frac{\theta\_{6}}{\theta\_{1}}} |  | (22) |
|  |  | \displaystyle= | \displaystyle\frac{\theta\_{6}}{\theta\_{1}}-\frac{\theta\_{2}\theta\_{3}\theta\_{5% }\theta\_{6}^{\theta\_{3}}}{\theta\_{1}^{\theta\_{3}+1}}\left(\frac{\theta\_{2}% \theta\_{6}^{\theta\_{3}}}{\theta\_{1}^{\theta\_{3}}}+\theta\_{4}\right)^{\theta\_{5% }-1}+\cdots |  |

under suitable constraints.

### 2.5 Finite mixtures

Some recently introduced distributions can be written as a finite mixture of g densities. These are the cases of a bimodal Weibull distribution–introduced by [31]– and the transmuted GEV distribution –introduced by [2].

It follows from (2) and Eq.(6) in [31] that the PDF of the bimodal Weibull can be written as:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle f(y;\alpha,\beta,\delta) | \displaystyle= | \displaystyle c\_{0}(\alpha,\beta,\delta)g(y;(0,1/\beta,1,0,\alpha,\alpha-1))+c% \_{1}(\alpha,\beta,\delta)g(y;(0,1/\beta,1,0,\alpha,\alpha)) |  |
|  |  | \displaystyle+ | \displaystyle c\_{2}(\alpha,\beta,\delta)g(y;(0,1/\beta,1,0,\alpha,\alpha+1)), |  |

where c\_{j}=cj(\alpha,\beta,\delta) are constants depending only on (\alpha,\beta,\delta) and c\_{0}+c\_{1}+c\_{2}=1.
