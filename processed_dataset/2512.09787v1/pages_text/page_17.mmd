Life data are sometimes modeled with the Gamma distribution and [11] or [13] discuss applications of the gamma distribution to life data.
The following dataset represents failure times of machine parts, some of which are manufactured by two manufacturers and were merged after a previous test which rejected the hypothesis of significant differences in the part life for the two manufacturers.

Descriptive statistics for the X,Y and Z RVs are presented in Table 2. For each dataset, the following summary statistics are given: the minimum value observed in the dataset (Min.);
the first quartile value (1st Qu.); the median value (Median); the average value (Mean); the third quartile value (3rd Qu.); the maximum value observed (Max.); the standard deviation (Sd.); the coefficient of Symmetry (CS); the coefficient of Kurtosis (CK); the sample size (n).
