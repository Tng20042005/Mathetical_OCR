In the next section, we apply Algorithms 4.4.2 and 4.4.2 to model real data.
The algorithms were implemented using the Python language [30] and the optimizers `optimize.scipy` [32] and `hyperopt` [3].
Furthermore, the R software [17] was used to obtain descriptive statistics and the figures presented throughout this article (with the exception of Figure 4, which was generated in Python). All the code and a tutorial on how to use it are available at https://github.com/eip-unb/positive\_support\_asymmetric

## 5 Applications

In order to show the versatility of extreme value \mathbb{H}-function class of distributions, we show that the model was able to fit three datasets with distinct characteristics.
Until now, these datasets had been effectively modeled by three different and competing models [11, 19, 29]. Here, we unify them into the model (4). Even when accounting for penalties due to the increased number of parameters, the new model is at least as effective as its particular cases, demonstrating the versatility of the model.

The study by [19] shown that Frechét distributions fitted better the minimum monthly flows of water (m^{3}/s) on the Piracicaba Riber, located in São Paulo state, Brazil, from 1960 to 2014. We took the minimum monthly flow for September as presented below:

The strength of carbon fibers tested under stressing tensions is frequently used in the literature [29] and we take the strength data measured in GPa (Gigapascal) for single carbon fibers of 20 mm length as presented below
