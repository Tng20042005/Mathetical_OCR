To ensure a good model fit, we use Randomized Quantile (RQ) residuals, as defined by [7]. The RQ residuals are calculated using the formula
R\_{i}=\Phi^{-1}(G(y\_{i};\hat{\bm{\theta}})), where \hat{\bm{\theta}} is the estimated parameter, G(y\_{i};\hat{\bm{\theta}}) is the CDF (4) of the model fitted to each observation y\_{i}, and \Phi^{-1} represents the quantile of the standard normal distribution N(0,1). When F is continuous, the RQ residuals follow a standard normal distribution, excluding the impact of sampling variability in the estimated parameters.

For all datasets, the Quantile–Quantile (QQ) plots indicate that the \mathbb{H}-extreme distribution provides a superior fit compared to the original reference distributions. The improvement is particularly noticeable in the tails, where the residuals from the \mathbb{H}-extreme models exhibit a closer alignment with the theoretical reference lines. This behavior suggests that the proposed model more accurately captures the extreme-value behavior and tail dependence present in the data. In particular, visually the results from LSE seem a bit better than MLE, which is explained in the scenarios of small and moderate sample sizes. In those cases, MLE can suffer from high variance in the tail estimates because it relies heavily on the likelihood contributions of few extreme observations. LSE, which spreads the influence across all observations, can occasionally yield smoother (though less theoretically efficient, as demonstrated in Table 3) estimates in these regions. This does not affect our general conclusion that the \mathbb{H}-extreme distribution does provide a superior fit in the cases studied.

## 6 Conclusions

We studied a general class of probability distributions with positive support, which generalizes several well-known and established models in the literature. In this study, we described various theoretical properties of this class. Additionally, to define the model’s distribution function, we introduced the concept of the incomplete extreme value \mathbb{H}-function.

Two estimation methods were proposed for the new model. These methods were implemented computationally, and their results were validated by modeling three real-world datasets. These datasets had previously been modeled in existing literature using particular cases of the new model—specifically, the Fréchet, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. Our study demonstrates that this new class of distributions, despite having more parameters than the basic models, provides a better fit to the data. This conclusion is supported by information criteria based on penalized likelihood (AIC, BIC, and EDC).

Despite its superior fit, the new model presents computational challenges. These arise from the need to estimate six parameters, and the potential non-identifiability of the model can sometimes hinder or limit the performance of numerical optimization algorithms. Therefore, using good initial guesses and carefully controlling the search space are essential for successful optimization.

Potential future work could involve enhancing the optimization methods employed in this context. For instance, one approach might be to implement global search metaheuristics that build upon local search heuristics while also exploring variations in the search regions.
