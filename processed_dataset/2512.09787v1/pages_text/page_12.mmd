|  | \hat{\bm{\theta}}\_{n}^{MLE}\in\arg\max\_{\theta}\ell(\bm{\theta}). |  | (31) |

Observe that (30) is a continuous function of \bm{\theta}. Then, on a compact subset \Theta\_{0}\subset\Theta, there exists a maximum likelihood estimator.
Computationally, (30) is enough to find the MLE.
However, traditional methods of finding MLE via the gradient vector of \ell(\bm{\theta}) can be used.
For a more detailed discussion on conditions under which the MLE exists, we refer the reader to [24].

#### 4.3.1 Partial derivatives of the log-likelihood function

Possible candidates for the MLE are the vectors \bm{\theta}\in\Theta that satisfy the likelihood equation (cf. [24])

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial\_{\bm{\theta}}\ell(\bm{\theta})=\left(\partial\_{\theta\_{1}}\ell(\bm{% \theta}),\dots,\partial\_{\theta\_{6}}\ell(\bm{\theta})\right)=(0,\dots,0). |  |

Since the log-likelihood function (30) depends on c(\bm{\theta})=\mathbb{H}(\bm{\theta}), its derivatives, \partial\_{\bm{\theta}}c(\bm{\theta}), are needed to explicitly express \partial\_{\bm{\theta}}\ell(\bm{\theta}). Moreover, power functions of the form x^{\theta\_{5}} appear in (30). To simplify the derivatives, we obtain the gradient of the likelihood function when \theta\_{5}=m\in\mathbb{N}.
In this case, the MLE can be obtained using numerical procedures for solving the nonlinear system (cf. [4]):

###### Remark 4.1.

In the derivatives \partial\_{\bm{\theta\_{i}}}\ell(\bm{\theta}) below, we require \theta\_{5}=m\in\mathbb{N}. In computational terms of applying numerical methods to solve the system (32), there is no guarantee that \hat{\theta}\_{5}\in\mathbb{N}. We could overcome this problem by adding a projection step in the update rule of the numerical algorithm. That means, we could use the corrected estimator
