### 2.3 Stochastic representation

Let Y be a random variable with PDF g(\cdot;\bm{\theta}) given in (2).
In this subsection, we prove that Y has the following stochastic representation

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle Y\stackrel{{\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}\sum\_{n=0}^{\infty}X\_{n}1\_{\{W\_% {n}=n\}}, |  | (13) |

where “\stackrel{{\scriptstyle d}}{{=}}” denotes equality in distribution, X\_{n} and W\_{n} are independent, X\_{n} is an absolutely continuous random variable with CDF (for x>0)

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle F\_{X\_{n}}(x)=\dfrac{E[(\theta\_{2}Z^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{n% \theta\_{5}}{1}\_{\{Z\leq x\}}]}{E[(\theta\_{2}Z^{\theta\_{3}}+\theta\_{4})^{n% \theta\_{5}}]},\quad Z\sim{\rm Gamma(\theta\_{6}+1,\theta\_{1})} |  | (14) |

and
W\_{n} is a discrete random variable with probability function
