Write f=\proj\_{\supp(\nu)} and \eps=\cE\_{p}(\kappa;\mu,\nu). Fix a coupling X,Y,Z such that (X,Z)\sim(\Id,\kappa)\_{\sharp}\mu, Y\sim\nu, and \E[\|Z-Y\|^{p}]=\Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}\mu,\nu)^{p}\leq\eps^{p}. Taking Z^{\prime}=f(Z), we then bound

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\E[\|X-Z^{\prime}\|^{p}]^{1/p} | \displaystyle\leq\E[\|X-Z\|^{p}]^{1/p}+\E[\|Z-Z^{\prime}\|^{p}]^{1/p} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\E[\|X-Z\|^{p}]^{1/p}+\E[\|Z-f(Z)\|^{p}]^{1/p} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\Wp(\mu,\nu)+\eps+\E[\|Z-Y\|^{p}]^{1/p} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\Wp(\mu,\nu)+2\eps. |  |

Similarly, we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Wp(\kappa^{\prime}\_{\sharp}\mu,\nu) | \displaystyle\leq\E[\|Z^{\prime}-Y\|^{p}]^{1/p} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\E[\|Z-Y\|^{p}]^{1/p}+\E[\|Z-Z^{\prime}\|^{p}]^{1/p} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\leq\eps+\eps=2\eps. |  |

Thus, the sum of these two errors is at most 4\eps, as desired.

Now, fix target measure \nu=\frac{1}{2}\delta\_{-y}+\frac{1}{2}\delta\_{y}, where y=(1,\dots,1), and take c\in[0,1] to be tuned later. Then, for each 0\leq t\leq 1/2, define measure \mu\_{t}=(1/2-t)\delta\_{-cy}+(1/2+t)\delta\_{+cy}. Now, fix any kernel \kappa\in\cK(\cX,\{\pm y\}), where the codomain restriction is without loss of generality due to 15. Note that its performance on each \mu\_{t} is determined by the two-point distributions \kappa\_{\pm}\defeq\kappa\_{\pm cy}=(1-\alpha\_{\pm})\delta\_{-cy}+\alpha\_{\pm}%
\delta\_{cy}. In particular, for 0\leq t<1/2, we compute

|  |  | \displaystyle=\|y-(-y)\|^{p}\cdot\Wp\left(\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-t\right)\Ber(% \alpha\_{-})+\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+t\right)\Ber(\alpha\_{+}),\Ber\left(\tfrac{1}{2}% \right)\right)^{p} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=(2d)^{\frac{p}{2}}\,\Wp\left(\Ber\left(\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-t% \right)\alpha\_{-}+\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+t\right)\alpha\_{+}\right),\Ber\left(% \tfrac{1}{2}\right)\right)^{p} |  |
