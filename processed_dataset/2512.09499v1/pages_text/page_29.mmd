## Appendix E Additional Experiments

All code needed to reproduce our experiments and figures is available at https://github.com/sbnietert/map-estimation. Here, we include two additional experiments beyond those in the main body, one with higher dimensions and sample sizes, and one in dimension two, for visualization.

Figure 4: \cE\_{1} (left), optimality gap (middle), and feasibility gap (right) performance of nearest-neighbor and rounding estimators for Setting A.

First, in 3, we repeat the Setting A experiments from 6 (3, middle), but with N=10000, dimensions d\in\{5,10,15\}, and sample sizes n\in\{100,200,\dots,1000\}. To extend to these larger parameters, we reduced the number of iterations to T=5 and omitted the bootstrapped error bars. Also, we include the decomposition of \cE\_{1} into its optimality gap and feasibility gap components, the latter of which is measurably larger. As predicted by our analysis, our error rates worsen with dimension.

Finally, in 5, we provide a visual depiction of the rounding estimator on a toy checkerboard dataset. In the top left, we present our source measure (orange) and target measure (green). For the top right plot, we sampled n=100 source and target samples, rounded the source samples onto a regular grid with side length \delta=n^{-1/(d+2)} (orange), and computed an OT plan (light blue) from the rounded source samples to the target samples (green). For the bottom left, we rounded the full source distribution onto the same grid (orange), route these according to the same OT plan (light blue), reaching a destination measure (red) that approximates the target distribution (green).
