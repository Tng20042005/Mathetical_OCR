|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=d^{\frac{p}{2}}\bigl{[}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-t\right)\left(\alpha\_{% -}(1+c)^{p}+(1-\alpha\_{+})(1-c)^{p}\right) |  |

|  |  | \displaystyle\hskip 28.452756pt+\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+t\right)\left(\alpha\_{+}(1-% c)^{p}+(1-\alpha\_{+})(1+c)^{p}\right)\bigr{]}. |  |

Writing \Delta=\alpha\_{-}-\alpha\_{+}, we next bound

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\invisequals\Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}\mu\_{t},\nu)+\Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}% \mu\_{0},\nu) |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle=\sqrt{2d}\,\bigl{|}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-t\right)\alpha\_{-}+\left(% \tfrac{1}{2}+t\right)\alpha\_{+}-\tfrac{1}{2}\bigr{|}^{\frac{1}{p}}+\sqrt{2d}\,% \bigl{|}\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha\_{-}+\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha\_{+}-\tfrac{1}{2}\bigr{|}^{% \frac{1}{p}} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\geq\sqrt{2d}\,t^{\frac{1}{p}}\left|\alpha\_{+}-\alpha\_{-}\right|^% {\frac{1}{p}} |  | (subadditivity of a\mapsto a^{1/p}) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle=\sqrt{2d}\,t^{\frac{1}{p}}|\Delta|^{\frac{1}{p}} |  |

and we simplify

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\iint\|y-x\|^{p}\dd\kappa\_{x}(y)\dd\mu\_{0}(x) | \displaystyle=d^{\frac{p}{2}}\left(\frac{1+\alpha\_{-}-\alpha\_{+}}{2}(1+c)^{p}+% \frac{1-\alpha\_{-}+\alpha\_{+}}{2}(1-c)^{p}\right) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=d^{\frac{p}{2}}\left(\frac{1+\Delta}{2}(1+c)^{p}+\frac{1-\Delta}% {2}(1-c)^{p}\right) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\Wp(\mu\_{0},\nu) | \displaystyle=\sqrt{d}\,(1-c). |  |

Thus, we further bound

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\left[\left(\iint\|y-x\|^{p}\dd\kappa\_{x}(y)\dd\mu\_{0}(x)\right)^% {\frac{1}{p}}-\Wp(\mu\_{0},\nu)\right]\_{+} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle=\, | \displaystyle\sqrt{d}\left[\left(\frac{1+\Delta}{2}(1+c)^{p}+\frac{1-\Delta}{2% }(1-c)^{p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}-1+c\right]\_{+} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle=\, | \displaystyle\sqrt{d}\left[\left(\frac{1+\Delta}{2}(1+c)^{p}+\frac{1-\Delta}{2% }(1-c)^{p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}-1+c\right]. |  |

Combining, this gives

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\invisequals\cE\_{p}(\kappa;\mu\_{t},\nu)+\cE\_{p}(\kappa;\mu\_{0},\nu) |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\geq\left[\sqrt{d}\left(\frac{1+\Delta}{2}(1+c)^{p}+\frac{1-% \Delta}{2}(1-c)^{p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}-1+c+\sqrt{2d}\,t^{\frac{1}{p}}|\Delta% |^{\frac{1}{p}}\right] |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\geq\left[\sqrt{d}\left(\frac{1+\Delta}{2}(1+c)+
