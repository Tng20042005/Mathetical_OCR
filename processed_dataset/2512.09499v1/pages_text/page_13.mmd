The first inequality uses that (A^{p}+B^{p})^{1/p}-(a^{p}+b^{p})^{1/p}\leq([A-a]\_{+}^{p}+[B-b]\_{+}^{p})^{1/p}, which can be obtained by rearranging the \ell\_{p} triangle inequality and using that A=[A-a]\_{+}+A\land a. The second inequality uses the previous bound and the fact that \kappa^{\prime} is feasible for the \Wp(\gamma,\kappa^{\prime}\_{\sharp}\gamma) problem. The third uses the \Wp triangle inequality and Minkoswki’s inequality.

We next bound \Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}\gamma,\kappa^{\prime}\_{\sharp}\gamma). Let \pi\in\Pi(\kappa\_{\sharp}\mu,\nu) be an optimal plan for \Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}\mu,\nu) and define \lambda\in(1-\eps)\cP(\cY) by \lambda(\cdot)=\int\pi(\cdot|x)\dd\gamma(x). By construction, \Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}\gamma,\lambda)\leq\Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}\mu,\nu)\leq\tau. Moreover, both \lambda and \kappa^{\prime}\_{\sharp}\gamma are submeasures of \nu with mass 1-\eps, and so they must share common mass at least 1-2\eps. This implies that their TV distance is at most \eps, and so Fact 1 gives that

|  | \Wp(\kappa\_{\sharp}\gamma,\kappa^{\prime}\_{\sharp}\gamma)\leq\tau+\Wp(\lambda,% \kappa^{\prime}\_{\sharp}\gamma)\leq\tau+D\eps^{\frac{1}{p}}. |  | (8) |

Thus, the previous bound on the optimality gap can be tightened to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left(\iint\|y-x\|^{p}\dd\kappa\_{x}(y)\dd\mu^{\prime}(x)\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}-% \Wp(\mu^{\prime},\nu)\leq\tau+2D\eps^{\frac{1}{p}}. |  |

Similarly, we bound the feasibility gap by
