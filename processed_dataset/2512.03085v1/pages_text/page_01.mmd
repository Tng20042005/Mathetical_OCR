Explicit constants for Fejér-type smoothing on finite cyclic groups

# Explicit constants for Fejér-type smoothing on finite cyclic groups

Justin Grieshop

###### Abstract

We give a self-contained discussion of a Fejér-type smoothing kernel on the finite cyclic group \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}, N\geq 2, and prove a simple L^{2}\to L^{\infty} estimate with explicit constants. As an application, we obtain a smoothed discrepancy bound for mean-zero functions on \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}, which may be interpreted, for instance, for indicator functions of subsets. The results are classical in spirit and close in flavor to standard estimates in discrete Fourier analysis and the theory of exponential sums. The main purpose of this note is to record the finite-group formulation with explicit norms in a way that is convenient for applications.

## 1 Introduction

Fejér kernels and their relatives play a central role in classical Fourier analysis and in analytic number theory, especially in connection with Cesàro averages and smoothed estimates; see, for example, Zygmund [2] or Montgomery–Vaughan [1]. In the continuous setting, Fejér kernels provide an approximate identity with good positivity and regularity properties. On finite cyclic groups, analogous kernels can be used to smooth functions and to control various notions of discrepancy.

The goal of this short note is twofold:

* •

  to record a convenient, entirely finite-group version of a Fejér-type kernel on the cyclic group \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}, and
* •

  to prove a simple L^{2}\to L^{\infty} bound with an explicit constant, leading to a smoothed discrepancy estimate for mean-zero functions.

The results are not new in principle; they are implicit in standard discrete Fourier-analytic arguments (see, for instance, [1, Ch. VII] or [3, Ch. 1]). However, the finite-group formulation with explicit norms appears not to be written down in one place in this exact form, and it is convenient to have a self-contained reference.

We emphasize that all arguments take place in the finite setting \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z} and rely only on elementary properties of discrete Fourier transforms. No asymptotic limits are required, and all constants are explicit.
