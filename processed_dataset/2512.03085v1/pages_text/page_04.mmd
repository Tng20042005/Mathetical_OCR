|  | \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}^{2}=\sum\_{n\in\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}}|F\_{r}(n)|^{2}=\frac{1}{r^{% 2}}\Biggl{(}1+2\sum\_{n=1}^{r-1}\Bigl{(}1-\frac{n}{r}\Bigr{)}^{2}\Biggr{)}=% \frac{1}{r^{2}}+\frac{(r-1)(2r-1)}{3r^{3}}. |  |

In particular,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}^{2}\leq\frac{5}{3r}\quad\text{and hence}\quad\|F\_{r}\|\_{2}\leq% \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\,r^{-1/2}. |  |

###### Proof.

We compute as in the proof of Lemma 3.2:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}^{2}=\sum\_{|n|\leq r-1}\frac{1}{r^{2}}\Bigl{(}1-\frac{|n|}{r}% \Bigr{)}^{2}=\frac{1}{r^{2}}\Biggl{(}1+2\sum\_{n=1}^{r-1}\Bigl{(}1-\frac{n}{r}% \Bigr{)}^{2}\Biggr{)}. |  |

Setting j=r-n, we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{n=1}^{r-1}\Bigl{(}1-\frac{n}{r}\Bigr{)}^{2}=\sum\_{j=1}^{r-1}\Bigl{(}% \frac{j}{r}\Bigr{)}^{2}=\frac{1}{r^{2}}\sum\_{j=1}^{r-1}j^{2}=\frac{1}{r^{2}}% \cdot\frac{(r-1)r(2r-1)}{6}. |  |

Thus

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}^{2}=\frac{1}{r^{2}}+\frac{2}{r^{2}}\cdot\frac{(r-1)r(2r-1)}{6r^{% 2}}=\frac{1}{r^{2}}+\frac{(r-1)(2r-1)}{3r^{3}}. |  |

For the inequality, note that (r-1)(2r-1)\leq 2r^{2} for all r\geq 1, giving

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}^{2}\leq\frac{1}{r^{2}}+\frac{2r^{2}}{3r^{3}}=\frac{1}{r^{2}}+% \frac{2}{3r}\leq\frac{5}{3r}, |  |

whence the stated bound on \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}.
∎

###### Remark 3.4 (Asymptotic behavior).

The bound \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}^{2}\leq\frac{5}{3r} derived above is valid for all r\geq 1. However, for large smoothing parameters r, the exact formula in Lemma 3.3 is dominated by the term \frac{2r^{2}}{3r^{3}}. Thus, asymptotically, one has \|F\_{r}\|\_{2}\sim\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\,r^{-1/2}. This suggests that for large r, the constant in Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.2 effectively improves from \sqrt{5/3}\approx 1.29 to \sqrt{2/3}\approx 0.82.

## 4 Fourier symbol and positivity

We now compute the Fourier transform of F\_{r} and verify that it is a nonnegative symbol bounded by 1. The key observation is that F\_{r} can be written as a normalized autocorrelation of a discrete boxcar window.

###### Lemma 4.1 (Autocorrelation representation).

Let N\geq 2 and 1\leq r\leq\lfloor N/2\rfloor. Define g:\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}\to\{0,1\} by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g(n):=\mathbf{1}\_{\{0,\dots,r-1\}}(n)\qquad(n\in\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}). |  |

Then for all n\in\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | F\_{r}(n)=\frac{1}{r^{2}}\sum\_{m\in\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}}g(m)g(n+m). |  |

###### Proof.

The sum \sum\_{m}g(m)g(n+m) counts the number of pairs (m,\ell) with

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m\in\{0,\dots,r-1\},\quad\ell:=n+m\in\{0,\dots,r-1\}, |  |

i.e. pairs (m,\ell)\in\{0,\dots,r-1\}^{2} with \ell-m\equiv n\pmod{N}. Since r\leq N/2, we may identify n with an integer in \{-(N-1)/2,\dots,(N-1)/2\}. For |n|\geq r there are no such pairs, so the sum is zero and F\_{r}(n)=0 by definition. For |n|\leq r-1, a simple counting argument shows that there are exactly r-|n| solutions to \ell-m=n with m,\ell\in\{0,\dots,r-1\}, namely

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (m,\ell)=(0,n),\ (1,1+n),\ \dots,\ (r-1-|n|,r-1) |  |
