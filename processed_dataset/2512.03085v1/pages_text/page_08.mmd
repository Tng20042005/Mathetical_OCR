## 7 Concluding remarks

We have recorded a finite-group version of a Fejér-type triangular kernel on \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}, together with a simple L^{2}\to L^{\infty} estimate and a corresponding smoothed discrepancy bound for mean-zero functions. The arguments are entirely elementary and rely only on basic discrete Fourier analysis and Cauchy–Schwarz.

The same methods apply, with minor modifications, to other positive, finitely supported kernels on \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}, as well as to higher-dimensional tori (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{d}. One can also combine such smoothing kernels with more refined tools such as the large sieve inequality to obtain sharper estimates in specific arithmetic applications; see, for example, [1] or the discussion of discrete convolution methods in [3].
