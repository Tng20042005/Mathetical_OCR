To obtain Proposition 3.2 from Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4, we also need the following i.i.d. structure of \{\ell\_{i}\}\_{i\geq 1}, which is a radial variant of the Brownian beads decomposition established in [Vir03].

###### Lemma 3.5.

We have:

1. (i)

   Let g:D(\ell\_{1})\to\mathbbm{D} be the conformal map such that g(0)=0 and g(B\_{t\_{1}})=1. Then g(\widetilde{\ell}\_{1}) is independent of \ell\_{1}. In particular, \mathrm{CR}(\rho,0) is independent of \ell\_{1}.
2. (ii)

   Let \widetilde{g}:D(\widetilde{\ell}\_{1})\to\mathbbm{D} be the conformal map such that \widetilde{g}(0)=0 and \widetilde{g}(B\_{s\_{1}})=1. Then (\widetilde{g}(B\_{t}))\_{t\in[0,s\_{1}]} is independent of (B\_{t})\_{t\in[s\_{1},\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}]}, and has the same law (up to a time change) as (B\_{t})\_{t\in[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}]} conditioned on B\_{\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}}=1.

As a corollary, if we set \widetilde{\ell}\_{0}=\mathbbm{S}^{1}, then \left(\frac{\mathrm{CR}(\widetilde{\ell}\_{n},0)}{\mathrm{CR}(\ell\_{n},0)}%
\right)\_{n\geq 1} and \left(\frac{\mathrm{CR}(\ell\_{n+1},0)}{\mathrm{CR}(\widetilde{\ell}\_{n},0)}%
\right)\_{n\geq 0} are two i.i.d. r.v. sequences, and mutually independent of each other.

###### Proof.

We first prove (ii). Due to rotational invariance, it suffices to consider the case when conditioning on B\_{\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}}=1.
Let (Y\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} be the time reversal of (B\_{t})\_{t\in[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}]} conditioned on B\_{\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}}=1. Note that Y\_{t} is indeed a Brownian excursion in \mathbbm{D} from 1 to 0.
Let (\mathcal{F}\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} be the natural filtration of (Y\_{t})\_{t\geq 0}, and (\mathcal{G}\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} be the cut time filtration defined in [Vir03, Section 3] (i.e. \mathcal{G}\_{t} is the \sigma-field generated by \mathcal{F}\_{t} and the set of all cut times of (Y\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} before time t).
By [Vir03, Proposition 14], if \tau is a (\mathcal{G}\_{t})\_{t\geq 0}-stopping time such that \tau is also a cut time of (Y\_{t})\_{t\geq 0}, then the conditional law of (Y\_{\tau+u})\_{u\geq 0} given \mathcal{G}\_{\tau} is a Brownian excursion from Y\_{\tau} to 0 in the connected component of \mathbbm{D}\backslash Y[0,\tau] containing 0. Now we consider s\_{1}^{\prime}:=\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}-s\_{1}. Note that
s\_{1}^{\prime} is the first cut time of (Y\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} such that Y[0,s^{\prime}\_{1}] disconnects the origin from
