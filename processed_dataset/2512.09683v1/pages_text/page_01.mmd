###### Abstract

Motivated by critical planar percolation, we investigate a “backbone” event of planar Brownian motion, i.e. the existence of two disjoint subpaths on the Brownian trajectory connecting the \varepsilon-neighborhood of the starting point to a macroscopic distance. We show that the probability of this event is (\log|\log\varepsilon|)^{-1} up to a multiplicative constant.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview and the main result

There is a strong relation between the planar Brownian motion and critical percolation. In particular, for n\geq 1, the Brownian intersection exponent \zeta\_{n}=\frac{4n^{2}-1}{12} [LSW01a, LSW01b, LSW02] is the same as the alternating 2n-arm exponent of critical percolation [SW01]. This can be well understood in the view of conformal restriction [LSW03]: both of the *hulls* of Brownian motion and percolation cluster satisfy the restriction property, and therefore, their outer boundaries can both be described by Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) with parameter \kappa=\frac{8}{3}.

Note that in the critical percolation, one can also define the *monochromatic* arm exponents corresponding to that there exist n disjoint arms of the same color joining two boundaries of an annulus. Based on the relation between Brownian motion and critical percolation, it is natural to explore the analog of such monochromatic arm exponents in the context of Brownian motion. Recently, [NQSZ24] derives the exact value of percolation monochromatic 2-arm exponent, namely the *backbone exponent*. In this paper, we investigate its Brownian counterpart, and find that such Brownian backbone probability indeed has an iterated logarithmic decay (so the “Brownian backbone exponent” is equal to 0). This also shows a big difference between Brownian motion and critical percolation, although their outer boundaries (or hulls) are the same.

To be precise, let (B\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} be a planar Brownian motion starting from 0. Denote \mathbbm{S}^{1}:=\{z\in\mathbbm{C}:|z|=1\} and \mathbbm{D}:=\{z\in\mathbbm{C}:|z|<1\} to be the unit circle and the unit disk, respectively. Let \tau\_{\mathbbm{D}} be the first hitting time of \mathbbm{S}^{1} for (B\_{t})\_{t\geq 0}.
For each \varepsilon\in(0,\frac{1}{2}), consider the event

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathsf{Bac}\_{\varepsilon}=\{\exists\ \text{two disjoint subpaths on the % trajectory }B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}]\text{ joining }\varepsilon\mathbbm{S}^{1}% \text{ and }\frac{1}{2}\mathbbm{S}^{1}\}. |  | (1.1) |

Namely, \mathsf{Bac}\_{\varepsilon} happens if there are two continuous curves \gamma^{1},\gamma^{2}:[0,1]\to\mathbbm{C} such that \gamma^{1}[0,1]\cap\gamma^{2}[0,1]=\emptyset, \gamma^{i}[0,1]\subset B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}], \gamma^{i}(0)\in\varepsilon\mathbbm{S}^{1}, and \gamma^{i}(1)\in\frac{1}{2}\mathbbm{S}^{1} for i=1,2. Using terminology from percolation, we call \mathsf{Bac}\_{\varepsilon} the *backbone event* for the Brownian trajectory B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}].

The main result in this paper is the following iterated logarithmic decay for the probability \mathbbm{P}[\mathsf{Bac}\_{\varepsilon}].

###### Theorem 1.1.

There exist constants C\_{1},C\_{2}>0 such that for any \varepsilon\in(0,\frac{1}{10}),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \frac{C\_{1}}{\log|\log\varepsilon|}\leq\mathbbm{P}[\mathsf{Bac}\_{\varepsilon}]% \leq\frac{C\_{2}}{\log|\log\varepsilon|}. |  | (1.2) |

###### Remark 1.2.

The same result also holds when \frac{1}{2}\mathbbm{S}^{1} in (1.1) is changed to any fixed r\mathbbm{S}^{1} with r\in(0,1) (and for sufficiently small \varepsilon), except that the corresponding constants in (1.2) will depend on r.
