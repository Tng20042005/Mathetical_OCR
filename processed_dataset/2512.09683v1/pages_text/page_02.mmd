Note that the backbone event \mathsf{Bac}\_{\varepsilon} is closely related to the spatial distribution of the *cut points* of B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}]. Indeed, our proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on our recent paper with Fu and Sun [CFSX25], from which we can define a layer structure for the cut points of B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}] and then solve it explicitly; see Section 3. We mention that [CFSX25] heavily relies on the connection between planar Brownian motion and \operatorname{SLE}\_{8/3}, and especially their coupling with Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). It would be quite interesting to see if there is a derivation of Theorem 1.1 without relying on LQG.

Theorem 1.1 is related to a certain kind of special points of Brownian motion. Namely, let

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{B}:=\{B\_{s}:s\in[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}})\text{ and there exists }% \varepsilon>0\text{ such that }(B\_{s+u})\_{0\leq u\leq\varepsilon}\text{ does % not have a cut point}\}. |  |

Then Theorem 1.1 indicates that \mathcal{B} is non-empty and has Hausdorff dimension 2. Furthermore, it also suggests that the Hausdorff measure of \mathcal{B} with the gauge r\mapsto r^{2}\log\frac{1}{r}\log\log\frac{1}{r}\log\log\log\frac{1}{r} would exist and be non-trivial (since the Hausdorff gauge of B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}] itself is r\mapsto r^{2}\log\frac{1}{r}\log\log\log\frac{1}{r}, see e.g. [LG85]). In particular, due to that planar Brownian motion a.s. has no double cut points [BL90], we know that \mathcal{B} contains the set of double points of (B\_{t})\_{0\leq t\leq\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}}, which has the Hausdorff gauge r\mapsto r^{2}(\log\frac{1}{r}\log\log\log\frac{1}{r})^{2} [LG87].

### 1.2 Outlook and discussions

Here we give several remarks and related questions before going into the proof.

  One can similarly consider the probability that there exist 2n disjoint subpaths on B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}] joining \varepsilon\mathbbm{S}^{1} and \frac{1}{2}\mathbbm{S}^{1} with n\geq 2. Note that for n\geq 2, such 2n-arm probability is not straightforwardly related to the cut points of B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}]. Instead, one need to consider the (2n-1)-tuples of the local cut points such that removing these (2n-1) cut points from the trajectory B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}], 0 and B\_{\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}} are not in the same connected component of the remaining set. However, analyzing such tuples of local cut points (e.g. the counterpart of the layer structure in Section 3) becomes much more complicated, and it seems difficult to solve them explicitly. We mention that similar difficulty also appears in deriving the monochromatic k-arm exponents of critical planar percolation for k\geq 3, see [NQSZ24, Remark 2.3].

  There is also a natural half-plane variant of our setup. Namely, let (e\_{t})\_{t\geq 0} be the Brownian excursion on the upper half plane \mathbbm{H} from 0 to \infty, and define R\mathbbm{S}^{+}:=R\mathbbm{S}^{1}\cap\mathbbm{H} for R>0. Then for n\geq 1, consider the asymptotic probability that
  there exists (2n+1) disjoint subpaths on the trajectory of (e\_{t}) joining \mathbbm{S}^{+} and R\mathbbm{S}^{+} as R\to\infty.
  Note that the case n=1 can be similarly related to the cut points of (e\_{t}), which has been proven in [Vir03, Theorem 4].

  In our forthcoming work [CX25], we will extend the result of this paper to the Brownian loop soup cases. Let (B\_{t})\_{0\leq t\leq\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}} be as before, and let \mathcal{L} be an independent Brownian loop soup on \mathbbm{D} with intensity \frac{c}{2} for c\in(0,1].
  For a subset A\subset\overline{\mathbbm{D}}, denote \mathcal{C}(A) to be the union of A and all loop-soup clusters in \mathcal{L} intersecting with A,
  and let H:=\mathcal{C}(B[0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}]).
  However, unlike the Brownian motion case,
  there is a positive probability that 0 itself can have two disjoint subpaths (except on 0) on H
  connected to \frac{1}{2}\mathbbm{S}^{1}. Moreover, in [CX25] we will show the following

  ###### Theorem 1.3.

  We say t\in(0,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}] is a cut time of H if \mathcal{C}(B[0,t])\cap\mathcal{C}(B[t,\tau\_{\mathbbm{D}}])=B\_{t}. Let t\_{1} be the largest cut time of H such that the boundary of \mathcal{C}(B[0,t\_{1}]) is a simple loop, and denote E to be the event that t\_{1} is the smallest cut time of H.
  Then for c\in(0,1),

  |  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  |  | \mathbbm{P}[E]=2^{\frac{c+1}{2}}\sqrt{\frac{6}{1-c}}\left(\int\_{0}^{\infty}% \tau^{-1-\frac{c}{2}}e^{\frac{1-c}{6}\pi\tau}\eta(2i\tau)^{1-c}d\tau\right)^{-1} |  | (1.3) |

  where \eta(2i\tau):=e^{-\frac{\pi}{6}\tau}\prod\_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(1-e^{-4\pi n\tau%
  }\right) is the Dedekind eta function.

  Note that the right side of (1.3) tends to 1 as c\uparrow 1, and tends to 0 as c\downarrow 0.
