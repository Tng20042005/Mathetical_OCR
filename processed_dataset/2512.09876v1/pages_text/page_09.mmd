Finally, the twists defined above only depends on the class of \mathcal{L}
modulo squares. Let us be more precise. First, for any line bundle \mathcal{L}^{\prime},
there exists an equality: \mathcal{M}\_{n}(E,\mathcal{L}^{\prime\otimes 2})=\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E),
according to Formula (1.1.1.b).
One deduces that any isomorphism \varphi:\mathcal{L}\rightarrow\mathcal{L}^{\prime,\otimes 2}
(also called an *orientation of \mathcal{L}*) induces a canonical isomorphism:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.1.4.a) |  | \varphi\_{\*}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E,% \mathcal{L}^{\prime\otimes 2})=\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E). |  |

###### Remark 1.1.5.

It is reasonable to expect the rule 1.1.1 to hold because the base scheme S is excellent. Otherwhise, one would have to ask for the identity:

\partial\_{v}\circ\phi^{\*}=\sum\_{w}(d\_{w})\_{\epsilon}(\phi\_{w})^{\*}\circ%
\partial\_{w},

where we used the notations of 1.1.1 and where d\_{w} is the defect of w (see [Dég25, Prop. 5.3.12])

###### Remark 1.1.6.

If \mathcal{M} is a MW-prehomodule and n an integer, then we can define the n-shifted MW-prehomodule associated to \mathcal{M}, denoted \mathcal{M}\{n\}, by the formula:

\mathcal{M}\{n\}\_{m}(E)=\mathcal{M}\_{m+n}(E)

for any integer m and any S-field E.

###### Example 1.1.7.

The main source of MW-prehomodule comes from a twisted Borel-Moore homology theory333This can be defined by using the properties of bivariant theories in [DJK21, §2],
and working over the fix base scheme S.
H\_{\*} relative to the base S.

1. (1)

   One can consider H\_{\*}=K^{\prime}\_{\*} the Quillen K^{\prime}-theory or Thomason’s G-theory.
   The associated MW-prehomodule \mathcal{K}\_{\*} is in fact oriented in the sense of 3.5.2, so that twists by line bundles are trivial.
2. (2)

   Let us assume that S admits a dualizing complex K\_{S}.
   Then one can define the hermitian analog of K’-theory using the fundamental work [CDH{}^{+}23, CDH{}^{+}25] as follows.
   Let f:X\rightarrow S be a morphism essentially of finite type, and let K\_{X}:=f^{!}K\_{S} seen as a dualizing complex. Let \mathcal{L} be a line bundle over X
   and n be an integer.
   One considers the stable \infty-category \mathrm{D}^{b}\_{coh}(X) of derived coherent sheaves on X,
   and equipped it with the Poincaré structure with quadratic functor \text{\text{\char 21}}=\operatorname{\underline{Hom}}(-,\mathcal{L}\otimes K\_{%
   X}[n]) ([CDH{}^{+}23, Def. 1.2.8]).
   Then we denote by \operatorname{GW}^{BM[n]}(X,\mathcal{L}) the associated Grothendieck-Witt spectrum as defined in [CDH{}^{+}25, Def. 4.2.1],
   and put \operatorname{GW}^{BM[n]}\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{L})=\pi\_{\*}\operatorname{GW}^{BM}(X,%
   \mathcal{L}).
   Taking all n and \mathcal{L} together, one gets a twisted Borel-Moore homology theory.
   The pushforward and pullback functorialities follow from the functoriality of the construction of the associated Grothendieck-Witt spectrum,
   and the localization long exact sequence from [CDH{}^{+}25, Cor. 4.2.2].
