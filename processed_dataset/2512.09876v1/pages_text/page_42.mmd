so that we have the (trivial) *duality isomorphism* (3.3.7.c).
When X=S, we simply write: A^{p}(X,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) for the above cohomology group.

The functoriality properties can be translated from the homological case,
using (3.3.7.c). Let us be more explicit for the comfort of the reader.
Given an slci morphism f:Y\rightarrow X (resp. proper morphism \pi:X^{\prime}\rightarrow X)
of essentially slci S-schemes, one gets:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle f^{\*}: | \displaystyle A^{p}(X/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L})\rightarrow A^{p}(Y/S,M\_{q},f^{\*}% \mathcal{L}), | (2.4.0.a). |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\pi\_{!}: | \displaystyle A^{p}(X^{\prime}/S,M\_{q},\omega\_{\pi}\otimes\pi^{\*}\mathcal{L})% \rightarrow A^{p}(X/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}), | \displaystyle\text{\lx@cref{creftypecap~refnum}{num:pushforward}}. |  |

Note that \omega\_{\pi} is well-defined as \pi is quasi-smooth under our assumptions.
In fact, A^{p}(-/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) is a cohomology theory on any of the sites
defined in 2.2.7. Moreover,
it is SL-oriented according to 2.4.2,
and admits an action of Euler classes according to 2.3.1.

###### 4.2.2.

Canonical choices (regular case).
It is relevant to consider a simpler notation when X=S is a regular scheme.
As in 4.1.5, we consider the canonical pinning \lambda such that \lambda\_{x}=\omega\_{x},
for any point x:\operatorname{Spec}(E)\rightarrow X with canonical sheaf \omega\_{x};
and the canonical dimension function \delta=-\operatorname{codim}\_{X}. Note that these choices correspond to the choice of dualizing complex K\_{X}=\mathcal{O}\_{X}
on X (see 3.1.5).

Let M be a the MW-module as in (4.1.1.a), and \mathcal{L} a line bundle over X.
With the preceding choices, the definition of the previous paragraph in the case X=S allow
to define the cohomological Chow-Witt groups of X with twists \mathcal{L} and with coefficients in M:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | C^{p}(X,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}):=\bigoplus\_{x\in X^{(p)}}M\_{q-p}(x,\nu\_{x}\otimes% \mathcal{L}\_{x}^{\vee}),A^{p}(X,M\_{q},\mathcal{L})=H\_{p}(C^{p}(X,M\_{q},% \mathcal{L})). |  |

where x\in X^{(p)} now really is a codimension p point of X,
and \nu\_{x}=\det(\mathcal{N}\_{x/S\_{(x)}}). One also defines the codimension p cycles on X with coefficients in M
as Z^{p}(X,M\_{q},\mathcal{L})\subset C^{p}(X,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) defined by the kernel of the differential of the complex.
Let us introduce an explicit definition.

###### Definition 4.2.3.

Consider the above notation: X a regular scheme, \mathcal{L} a line bundle over X,
and the choices of pinning and dimension function are normalized by the choice of dualizing complex
K\_{X}=\mathcal{O}\_{X}. Specializing the above definition by taking M=\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}, q=p, one defines the *Chow-Witt group*
