Note this theory is periodic with period 4 in n ([CDH{}^{+}23, Cor. 3.5.16]).
   Therefore, we get an associated family of four MW-homodules, \mathcal{GW}^{[i]} for 0\leq i\leq 3,
   with the convention that for a point x:\operatorname{Spec}(E)\rightarrow S and an integer n\in\mathbf{Z},
   \mathcal{GW}^{[i]}\_{\{n\}}(E)=\operatorname{GW}^{BM,[i+n]}\_{n}(x). Note we have used the notation \{n\} to avoid the ambiguity in the indexing.

   Same as above but with the Witt groups (i.e. take the bordification of the GW-hermitian K-theory \operatorname{GW}^{BM} as in [CDH{}^{+}25, §4.4]).
   The resulting MW-prehomodule is denoted by \mathcal{W}\_{\*}. Note that by definition,
   this MW-prehomodule is periodic: \mathcal{W}\_{n}(E)=\mathcal{W}\_{n+1}(E).

   More generally, let \mathbb{E} be a motivic spectrum over S.
   Then the associated Borel-Moore homology H\_{\*}=\mathbb{E}\_{\{\*\}}^{BM} does induce a MW-prehomodule.
   In fact, we will get a family indexed by integers n\in\mathbf{Z} of such MW-prehomodules, by considering \mathbb{E}[n].
   We will generally denote by \mathcal{H}\_{n,\*} this last MW-prehomodule.

   This example contains all the previous ones. We refer the reader to [DFJ22, §3].

### 1.2. Homological Milnor-Witt cycle modules

###### 1.2.1.

Throughout this section, \mathcal{M} denotes a MW-prehomodule over S, X a scheme over S, n an integer and \* a line bundle (over X). We put

\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*)=\mathcal{M}\_{n}(\kappa(x),\*).

Let x,y be two points in X. We define a map

\partial^{x}\_{y}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*)\to\mathcal{M}\_{n-1}(y,\*)

as follows. Let Z=\overline{\{x\}}. If y\not\in Z^{(1)}, then put \partial^{x}\_{y}=0. If y\in Z^{(1)}, then the local ring of Z at y gives us a map

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.2.1.a) |  | \displaystyle\partial^{x}\_{y}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*)\to\mathcal{M}\_{n-1}(y,\*), |  |

according to 1.1.1.

###### Definition 1.2.2.

A *homological Milnor-Witt cycle module* \mathcal{M}, or simply *MW-homodule*, over S is a homological Milnor-Witt cycle premodule \mathcal{M} which satisfies the following conditions 1.2.2 and 1.2.2.

(FD’):
:   Finite support of divisors. Let X be an irreducible scheme over S with generic point \xi\_{X}, n an integer, \* a line bundle over X, and \rho an element of \mathcal{M}\_{n}(\xi\_{X},\*). Then \partial\_{x}(\rho)=0 for all but finitely many x\in X^{(1)}.

(C’):
:   Closedness. Let X be integral and local of dimension 2, n an integer, and \* a line bundle over X. Then

    0=\displaystyle\sum\_{x\in X\_{(1)}}\partial^{x}\_{x\_{0}}\circ\partial^{\xi}\_{x}:%
    \mathcal{M}\_{n}(\xi\_{X},\*)\to\mathcal{M}\_{n-2}(x\_{0},\*)

    where \xi\_{X} is the generic point and x\_{0} the closed point of X.

It is important to note that both conditions do not depend on the particular
choice of the dimension function \delta on X, as the difference of two dimension functions
is a Zariski locally constant function on S.

###### 1.2.3.

Of course 1.2.2 makes sense only under presence of 1.2.2 which guarantees finiteness in the sum.
More generally, note that if 1.2.2 holds, then for any scheme X, any x\in X and any \rho\in\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*) one has \partial^{x}\_{y}(\rho)=0 for all but finitely many y\in X.

###### 1.2.4.

If X is irreducible with generic point \xi\_{X} and 1.2.2 holds for the reduced scheme X\_{\mathtt{red}}, we put for any integer n and any line bundle \*:

d=(\partial^{\xi\_{X}}\_{x})\_{x\in X\_{(1)}}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(\xi\_{X},\*)\to%
\displaystyle\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(1)}}\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*).
