The authors warmly thank Håkon Kolderup for a crucial improvement of the
proof of 4.4.6 (formerly Corollary 4.4.6), allowing us to pass
from totally imaginary number fields to arbitrary ones.

They also thank Adrien Dubouloz, Jean Fasel, Marc Levine, Paul Arne Østvær and Heng Xie
for conversations, exchanges and ideas that led to the present paper.

## 1. Homological Milnor-Witt cycle modules

### 1.1. Homological Milnor-Witt cycle premodules

The following definition is a homological version and generalization of [Fel20, Definition 3.1].

###### Definition 1.1.1.

A *homological Milnor-Witt cycle premodule* \mathcal{M}, or simply *MW-prehomodule*, over the base scheme S
and with coefficients in the ring R is an R-module \mathcal{M}\_{n}(E) for any field E over S and any integer n along with the following data 1.1.1,…, 1.1.1
and the following rules 1.1.1,…, 1.1.1.

(D2’):
:   Let \phi:E\to F be a finite field extension over S and n an integer. There exists a morphism \phi^{\*}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(F)\to\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E).

(D3’):
:   Let E be a field over S. For any element x of \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{n}(E), there is a morphism
    \gamma\_{x}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E)\to\mathcal{M}\_{m+n}(E)
    such that \mathcal{M}\_{\*}(E) is a left \mathbf{Z}-graded module over the graded ring \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}(E).

(D4’):
:   Let \mathcal{O} be a 1-dimensional local domain essentially of finite type over S with fraction field F and residue field \kappa.
    There exists a *residue* map, morphism of abelian groups

    |  |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | (1.1.1.a) |  | \displaystyle\partial\_{\mathcal{O}}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(F)\to\mathcal{M}\_{n-1}(% \kappa). |  |

    Let E be a field over S, n an integer and \mathcal{L} a 1-dimensional vector space over E, denote by

    |  |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | (1.1.1.b) |  | \mathcal{M}\_{n}(E,\mathcal{L}):=\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E)\otimes\_{R[E^{\times}]}R[% \mathcal{L}^{\times}] |  |

    where R[\mathcal{L}^{\times}] is the free R-module generated by the nonzero elements of \mathcal{L} and where the action of R[E^{\times}] on \mathcal{M}\_{n}(E) is given by u\mapsto\langle u\rangle thanks to 1.1.1.

(D1’):
:   Let \phi:E\to F be a field extension and n an integer. There exists a morphism of abelian groups
    \phi\_{!}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(E)\to\mathcal{M}\_{n}(F,\omega\_{F/E}).

(R1a’):
:   Let \phi and \psi be two composable morphisms of fields. One has (\psi\circ\phi)\_{!}=\psi\_{!}\circ\phi\_{!},
    up to the obvious identification for twists.

(R1b’):
:   Let \phi and \psi be two composable finite morphisms of fields. One
    has: (\psi\circ\phi)^{\*}=\phi^{\*}\circ\psi^{\*}.

(R1c’):
:   Consider \phi:E\to F and \psi:E\to L with \phi finite and \psi separable. Let A be the ring F\otimes\_{E}L. For each p\in\operatorname{Spec}A, let \phi\_{p}:L\to A/p and \psi\_{p}:F\to A/p be the morphisms induced by \phi and \psi. One has

    \psi\_{!}\circ\phi^{\*}=\displaystyle\sum\_{p\in\operatorname{Spec}A}(\phi\_{p})^{%
    \*}\circ(\psi\_{p})\_{!}.
