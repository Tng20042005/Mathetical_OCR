It is a quotient of the group of *quadratic cycles* \tilde{Z}^{p}(X,\mathcal{L})\subset\oplus\_{x\in X^{(p)}}\operatorname{GW}(%
\kappa(x),\nu\_{x}\otimes\mathcal{L}\_{x}^{\vee}), by the image of the differential operator of the complex
of cycles with coefficients in \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}; we call the corresponding equivalence relation on quadratic cycles
the *rational equivalence*.

###### 4.2.4.

Fasel and Srinivas,defined a twisted Chow-Witt group associated with a regular \mathbf{Z}[1/2]-scheme
in [FS09, Definition 32] when X is a \mathbf{Z}[1/2].
It follows from our definition and from the cartesian square (3.4.5.f)
that their definition coincides with ours. To be precise, there is a slight difference
in conventions and one has to change \mathcal{L} by \mathcal{L}^{\vee} to get exactly the same definition.
However, by definition of twists, there is a canonical isomorphism between the \mathcal{L}-twisted group
and the (\mathcal{L})^{\vee}-twisted one. Our choice is motivated by the duality isomorphism below.

###### Example 4.2.5.

Comparison with classical Chow groups.
Taking M=\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*},
q=p gives the Chow-group \operatorname{CH}^{p}(X) is made of the usual codimension p algebraic cycle classes of X.
Specializing (3.4.6.b) to our notation gives an exact sequence:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | A^{d}(X,\operatorname{I}^{d+1},\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\widetilde{\operatorname% {CH}}{}^{d}(X,\mathcal{L})\xrightarrow{F}\operatorname{CH}^{d}(X)\rightarrow 0 |  |

where d is the dimension of X.
More generally, we get as in 4.1.3, a canonical map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}^{p}(X,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\widetilde{% \operatorname{CH}}{}^{p}(X)\times A^{p}(X,\operatorname{W},\mathcal{L}) |  |

which is an isomorphism after inverting 2 (use 3.4.5).

One can rewrite the duality isomorphism (3.3.7.c)
with the conventions of 4.1.5 and 4.2.3 as follows.

###### Proposition 4.2.6.

Let f:X\rightarrow S be a morphism essentially of finite type between regular schemes.
Then, under the choice of conventions for homological and cohomological Chow-Witt groups from 4.1.5 and 4.2.3, there is a duality isomorphism:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})\simeq\widetilde{% \operatorname{CH}}{}^{d-p}(X,\omega\_{X/S}\otimes\mathcal{L}^{\vee}). |  |

Assume moreover that X is a \mathbf{Z}[1/2]-scheme.
Then the Chow-Witt group \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}^{p}(X,\mathcal{L}^{\vee}) defined above precisely coincides
with the Chow-Witt group
defined by Fasel and Srinivas in [FS09, Definition 32].

In particular, we have extended Fasel-Srinivas theory over regular schemes
to a Borel-Moore theory defined for S-schemes X essentially of finite type,
according to 4.1.2).

###### Example 4.2.7.

As a corollary, one deduces from [FS09, Theorem 34] that the group \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}^{p}(X,\mathcal{L}^{\vee})
can be identified with the E\_{2}-term, in degree (p,0),
of the coniveau spectral sequence of a regular \mathbf{Z}[1/2]-scheme X
with coefficients in hermitian K-theory. Based on the recent advances on [BYN22],
this can be extended to arbitrary regular schemes. One can also obtain this comparison by using
the homological Chow-Witt groups and the hermitian G-theory, based on coherent \mathcal{O}\_{X}-modules
rather than perfect complexes.

Let us consider again the choices of 4.1.5 for homology, K\_{S}=\mathcal{O}\_{S}[\dim(S)].
Then for any S-scheme X, the \mathbf{Z}-graded group A\_{\*}(X/S,\operatorname{W},\mathcal{L}) of (4.1.1.d) coincides
with the E\_{2}-term of the Gersten-Witt spectral sequence associated with the dualizing complex K\_{S}
as in [JX25, §3.1]. See *loc. cit.* Th. 4.2.5 for a proof, which act
