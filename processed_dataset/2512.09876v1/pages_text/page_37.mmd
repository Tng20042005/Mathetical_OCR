Let S be a base scheme.
There is a canonical equivalence between the category \operatorname{M-Mod}\_{S} and the category of Rost cycle modules over S.

###### Proof.

The data in Definition 3.2.1, as well as the four operations 3.2.1, 3.2.1, 3.2.1 and 3.2.1,
correspond precisely to Rost’s data for cycle modules ([Ros96, Definition 1.1]). Therefore it suffices to check that the relations in Definition 3.5.5 corresponds to Rost’s relations.
While most of the relations can be checked verbatim, we need to show that our axioms imply the following a priori stronger versions of Rost:

1. (R1cRost)

   Let \phi:E\to F and \psi:E\to L be morphisms of fields with \phi finite.
   Let A be the artinian ring F\otimes\_{E}L. For each prime p\in\operatorname{Spec}A, let \phi\_{p}:L\to A/p and \psi\_{p}:F\to A/p be the morphisms induced by \phi and \psi. Let l\_{p} be the length of the local ring A/p.
   One has:

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \psi\_{\*}\circ\phi^{!}=\sum\_{p\in\operatorname{Spec}A}l\_{p}\cdot(\phi\_{p})^{!}% \circ(\psi\_{p})\_{\*}. |  |
2. (R3aRost)

   Let \phi:E\to F be a morphism of S-fields. Let w be an S-valuation on F which restricts to a non-trivial valuation v on E of ramification index e, and denote by \overline{\phi}:\kappa(v)\to\kappa(w) the induced morphism of S-fields. Then

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (3.5.7.a) |  | \displaystyle\partial\_{w}\circ\phi\_{\*}=e\cdot\overline{\phi}\_{\*}\circ\partial\_% {v}. |  |

The axioms 3.5 and 3.5 can be proved using the methods in [Fel21b, §4], which finishes the proof.
∎

###### 3.5.8.

In the homological case, we define a *homological Milnor cycle module* as an \eta-trivial homological cycle module M (Definitions 1.2.2 and 3.4.2),
also called *M-homodule*.
Equivalently, M is M-hopremodule that satisfy the conditions 1.2.2 and 1.2.2 of 1.2.2.
We denote by \operatorname{M-Homod}\_{S} the category of homological Milnor cycle modules over S, considered as a full subcategory of the category of homological MW-cycle modules \operatorname{MW-Homod}\_{S}.

The following result states a duality between cohomological and homological versions of Milnor cycle modules:

###### Theorem 3.5.9 (Duality, oriented version).

Let S be a base scheme.
Given a Milnor cycle module M over S, for every S-field \operatorname{Spec}E, we let

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5.9.a) |  | \displaystyle\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}(M)(E,n)=M\_{n}(E). |  |

Reciprocally, given a homological Milnor cycle module \mathcal{M} over S, we let

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5.9.b) |  | \displaystyle\operatorname{D}(\mathcal{M})\_{n}(E)=\mathcal{M}(E,n). |  |

Then these two constructions establish two functors that are equivalences of categories inverse to each other

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5.9.c) |  | \displaystyle\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}:\operatorname{M-Mod}\_{S}\simeq% \operatorname{M-Homod}\_{S}:\operatorname{D}. |  |

###### Proof.

As all the twists have disappeared, the proof is straightforward with the functorialities 3.5.3.a and (3.5.4.a). We leave the details to the reader (see also the proof of Theorem 3.3.4 below). ∎
