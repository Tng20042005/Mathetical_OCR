An interesting part of this complex arises when q=-p,
giving the following 3-term complex:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.1.e) |  | \bigoplus\_{y\in X\_{(p+1)}}\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{1}(\kappa(y),\lambda\_{y}% \otimes\mathcal{L}\_{y})\xrightarrow{d\_{p+1}}\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}% \operatorname{GW}(\kappa(x),\lambda\_{x}\otimes\mathcal{L}\_{x})\xrightarrow{d\_{% p}}\bigoplus\_{s\in X\_{(p-1)}}\operatorname{W}(\kappa(s),\lambda\_{s}\otimes% \mathcal{L}\_{s}). |  |

###### Definition 4.1.2.

Consider the above notation.
One defines the *homological Chow-Witt and Chow groups* \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})=A\_{p}(X/S,\operatorname{K%
}^{MW}\_{-p},\mathcal{L})
and \operatorname{CH}\_{p}(X/S)=A\_{p}(X/S,\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{-p}), associated with (X,\mathcal{L}) and X in degree p,
relative to (S,\delta,\lambda).
In the case of \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p} this is the homology in the middle of the complex (4.1.1.e),
while for \operatorname{CH}\_{p}, it is the usual definition.171717See [Ros96, Remark 5.1], except we use
the dimension function \delta for the grading.

One also considers the group of *(homological) quadratic cycles* in degree p
as \widetilde{\operatorname{Z}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})=\operatorname{Ker}(d\_{p}). Two such quadratic cycles
are *rationally equivalent* if their difference belongs to the image of d\_{p-1}.

The rank map, or equivalently the map F of 3.4.5,
induces a canonical projection: \widetilde{\operatorname{Z}}{}\_{p}(X,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\operatorname{Z}\_{%
p}(X/S),
where the right hand-side are made of algebraic cycles of X, graded by \delta.
This map is compatible with rational equivalence, therefore inducing
a canonical map, compatible with all functorialities:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.2.a) |  | F:\widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\ % \operatorname{CH}\_{p}(X/S). |  |

Similarly, as the MW-module \operatorname{W} is the \eta-localisation of \operatorname{K}^{MW},
one gets a canonical map, compatible with all functorialities:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.2.b) |  | \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow A\_{p}(X/S,W,% \mathcal{L}), |  |

where the right hand-side is the Witt homology of X/S, (4.1.1.d).
It is also obtained by localizing the left-hand side with respect to the endomorphism \eta built in 1.4.5.
The next proposition extends a corollary 3.4.5 and extends a basic computation known over a field.

###### Proposition 4.1.3.

Consider the above notation. Then the canonical map:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\operatorname{% CH}\_{p}(X/S)\times A\_{p}(X/S,\operatorname{W},\mathcal{L}) |  |

made of (4.1.2.a) and (4.1.2.b) becomes an isomorphism after inverting 2.

Obviously, the same result holds with cohomological conventions (4.2.1.a).

###### Remark 4.1.4.

1. (1)

   While one can always twist a pinning by a line bundle,
   beware that the underlying pinning \lambda is defined over S while the twist \mathcal{L}
   considered above has only to be defined over an S-scheme X. This justifies our choice
   of notation.
2. (2)

   One can introduce several other numbering conventions, following the motivic literature:

   * •

     standard motivic notation:
     \widetilde{A}\_{p,q}(X/S,M,\mathcal{L}):=A\_{p-q}(X/S,M\_{-q},\mathcal{L}).
   * •

     Bloch numbering:
     \widetilde{A}\_{p}(X/S,M,\mathcal{L},q):=A\_{p+q}(X,M\_{-q},\mathcal{L}).
   * •

     numbering with respect to \mathbf{G}\_{m}-twists:
     \widetilde{A}\_{p}(X,M,\mathcal{L},\{q\}):=A\_{p}(X,M\_{-q},\mathcal{L}).

###### 4.1.5.

Canonical choices.
Recall that, over the base S, both choices of the pinning \lambda and the dimension function \delta
can be determined by the single choice of a dualizing complex K\_{S} (3.1.5).181818In case
the reader wants to be precise about those choices, we propose to replace \mathcal{L} in the previous notation
