In each case, the forgetful map (4.4.4.b) is an isomorphism.

###### Proof.

We treat the two cases separately.
First note that in both situations X is a one-dimensional, Noetherian scheme
finite over S=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}\_{F}). In particular, every closed point x\in X\_{(0)}
lies over a non-zero prime of \mathcal{O}\_{F}, hence \kappa(x) is a finite field.
For a finite field \kappa the fundamental ideal
I(\kappa)\subset W(\kappa) satisfies I(\kappa)^{2}=0. This verifies
hypothesis (1) of Theorem 4.4.6 for all the schemes under
consideration.
*Case (1): the non-separated Dedekind scheme X=S\sqcup\_{U}S.*
Let U=S\setminus\{\mathfrak{p}\} and let X be obtained by gluing two copies
S\_{1},S\_{2} of S along U:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | X\;=\;S\_{1}\sqcup\_{U}S\_{2}. |  |

Then X is a (possibly non-separated) Dedekind scheme: it is regular,
one-dimensional, and its local rings are DVRs away from the generic point.
All residue fields at closed points are again finite, so hypothesis (1) of
Theorem 4.4.6 holds for S and for any open subscheme of S.
By Example 4.4.7 and its extension to orders in \mathcal{O}\_{F}, the
hypotheses of Theorem 4.4.6 are satisfied on S and on any
affine open subscheme V\subset S (viewed as \operatorname{Spec} of an order in F), and
hence the forgetful map (4.4.4.b) is an isomorphism on S and on every
such V. Since the Chow and Chow-Witt groups in question are computed as
the homology of Rost-Schmid type complexes, they satisfy
Mayer-Vietoris for open coverings. It follows that the map
(4.4.4.b) is an isomorphism on any open subscheme of S, in
particular on U.
Now cover X by the two open subsets X\_{1},X\_{2} corresponding to the two
copies of S, with intersection X\_{1}\cap X\_{2}\simeq U. For this cover there
are Mayer-Vietoris exact sequences for the Chow-Witt groups and for the
Chow groups, and the forgetful map (4.4.4.b) is compatible with
these sequences. We have just seen that (4.4.4.b) is an isomorphism
on X\_{1}\simeq S, on X\_{2}\simeq S, and on their intersection
X\_{1}\cap X\_{2}\simeq U. A diagram chase (or the five lemma applied to the
Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequences) shows that the induced map
(4.4.4.b) on X is also an isomorphism.
*Case (2): the pinching X=S\sqcup\_{\{\mathfrak{p}\}}S.*
Let X be the Ferrand pinching

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | X\;=\;S\sqcup\_{\{\mathfrak{p}\}}S\;=\;\operatorname{Spec}\bigl{(}\mathcal{O}\_{% F}\times\_{\kappa(\mathfrak{p})}\mathcal{O}\_{F}\bigr{)}. |  |

Then X is a reduced, Noetherian, Nagata scheme of dimension 1, with
normalization

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | p:\widetilde{X}\longrightarrow X,\qquad\widetilde{X}\simeq S\sqcup S, |  |

and singular locus Z=\{x\} equal to the image of the closed point
\mathfrak{p}.
The fibre T=Z\times\_{X}\widetilde{X} consists of two closed points
y\_{1},y\_{2} with residue fields

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \kappa(y\_{1})\simeq\kappa(y\_{2})\simeq\kappa(x)\simeq\kappa(\mathfrak{p}). |  |

By the Bass-Milnor-Serre theorem we have \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(\mathcal{O}\_{F})=0, hence
\operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(S)=0 and therefore
