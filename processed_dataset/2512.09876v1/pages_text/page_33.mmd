ing to the usual convention, one puts: \operatorname{I}^{n}(E)=\operatorname{W}(E) for non-positive n.
   In particular, one can define a sub-MW-module \operatorname{I}^{\*}\subset\operatorname{W} over S, and there exists
   a canonical isomorphism:

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (3.4.4.a) |  | \displaystyle\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}\!/h=\operatorname{I}^{\*}. |  |

Based on the notation of the previous example, and on the, now proved, second Milnor conjecture,
one deduces the following fundamental exact sequences:

###### Theorem 3.4.5.

Let S be a scheme S which admits a pinning.
Let 2K\_{\*}^{M} (resp. K\_{\*}^{M}/2) be the image (resp. cokernel) of the multiplication by 2 map:
\gamma\_{2}:\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}\rightarrow\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}.141414Note that K\_{\*}^{M}/2 is also the 2-quotient of K\_{\*}^{M}
in the sense of the above proposition.
Then there exists exact sequences of MW-modules over S:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.4.5.a) |  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow\operatorname{I}^{\*}\{1\}\xrightarrow{\nu} | \displaystyle\operatorname{I}^{\*}\rightarrow\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}/2\rightarrow 0 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.4.5.b) |  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow\operatorname{I}^{\*}\{1\}\rightarrow | \displaystyle\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}\xrightarrow{F}\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}\rightarrow 0 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.4.5.c) |  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow 2\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}\xrightarrow{H} | \displaystyle\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}\xrightarrow{P}\operatorname{I}^{\*}\rightarrow 0 |  |

where \nu is the canonical inclusion, F and P are the canonical projection maps,
respectively called the forgetful and Pfister map.

Moreover, F\circ H:2\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}\rightarrow\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*} is the canonical injection,
so that the three short exact sequences become split after inverting 2.
Last, the map P induces an isomorphism of MW-modules over S:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.4.5.d) |  | W[1/2]\rightarrow\operatorname{I}^{\*}[1/2]. |  |

###### Proof.

The first exact sequence follows directly from the *Milnor isomorphism*:
for any field k and any 1-dimensional k-vector space L we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.4.5.e) |  | \displaystyle\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{n}(k)/2\simeq\operatorname{I}^{n}(k,L)/% \operatorname{I}^{n+1}(k,L) |  |

see [OVV07, Theorem 4.1], [Mor04, Théorème 2.1], and [Kat82] for the case of characteristic 2 - see also [Fas08, Lemme E.1.3] to deal with the twist by L.
