More precisely, we introduce the notion of a
*homological Milnor-Witt cycle module*
(aka *MW-homodule*, 1.2.2)
over an excellent base scheme S with a dimension function.
Although the definition appears notably different from Rost’s and Feld’s definitions, the axioms are indeed modeled on natural examples of Borel-Moore theories,
such as Quillen’s K^{\prime}-theory (or G-theory) or Gille’s homological Witt groups (1.3.6).
To any MW-homodule we associate a Rost-Schmid type complex of quadratic cycles,
whose homology satisfies the usual functorialities such as homotopy invariance, proper pushforwards, smooth pullbacks, and localization long exact sequences.
In particular, MW-homodules form a natural category of coefficients
for intersection theory, equipped with a Leray-type spectral sequence (2.1.2).
We then construct, for essentially smoothable lci morphisms,
Gysin morphisms and excess-intersection formulas,
and show that the resulting Borel-Moore theory is (canonically) *SL-oriented*,
in a sense slightly generalized from Panin-Walter [PW18]:
it admits an *action* of Thom and Euler classes. Furthermore, those theories satisfy the
homological form of cdh-descent, and more generally for hyperenvelope
(1.5.9, 1.5.10).

A new feature of our theory is the introduction of *pinnings* (3.1.3),
a datum induced by a dualizing complex, which allows us to define (cohomological)
MW-modules (3.3.2) whose axioms are closer to Rost’s and Feld’s theories.
Natural examples of MW-modules include Milnor and Milnor-Witt K-theories,
Witt groups and the powers of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring (3.3.6).
We then establish a duality equivalence 3.3.4 between homological and
cohomological versions, which is reminiscent of cohomological purity theorems.
Assuming S is essentially of finite type over a field,
this equivalence allows us to compare MW-modules with Feld’s theory,
and to show that Rost’s cycle modules coincide with *oriented* MW-modules.

From these constructions we derive several concrete applications.

1. (1)

   We define homological (resp. cohomological)
   *Chow-Witt groups* for any S-scheme essentially of finite type
   (resp. essentially lci) X, and any twist by a line bundle \mathcal{L}/X,
   extending the definition of Fasel-Srinivas [FS09] from regular
   schemes to possibly singular bases, and without assuming that 2 is invertible on S.
   These groups satisfy the property of a Borel-Moore homology relative to S
   as described above, including localization sequences, \mathbf{A}^{1}-homotopy invariance,
   and a canonical duality isomorphism

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})\simeq\widetilde{% \operatorname{CH}}{}^{d-p}(X,\omega\_{X/S}\otimes\mathcal{L}^{\vee}), |  |

   for d=\dim(X/S) (see 4.2.6 for details).
   When X and S are regular, our theory recovers Fasel-Srinivas’ definition
   after carefully choosing the gradings.
2. (2)

   Based on the main result of [BHP23],
   we prove a *generalized Bloch formula* over a regular scheme S
   of dimension at most 1,
   identifying Chow-Witt groups with the zeroth cohomology of a complex of
   *unramified Milnor-Witt sheaves*; see 4.3.5 for more details.
   As a corollary, we deduce the representability of both cohomological and homological
   Chow-Witt groups in the motivic homotopy category over S; see 4.3.8.
   This result was previously known only when S is the spectrum of a field.
3. (3)

   In general, one always has a comparison map (see 4.1.2.a):

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | F:\widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\operatorname% {CH}\_{p}(X). |  |

   It fits into various long exact sequences derived from the Milnor conjecture
   on Milnor K-theory and quadratic forms; see 3.4.6.
   When X=S is excellent of dimension 1 and p=0,
   we give a criterion in 4.4.6 for F to be an isomorphism.
   This applies to many examples: arbitrary orders in a number ring,
   affine regular curves over finite fields, and some other examples
   built out of spectra of number rings:
   doubled points (non-separated) or normal crossings (singular).

In fact, the third result can be strengthened. The following result gives a complete computation of the *graded Chow-Witt groups*,
namely the cohomology of the Rost-Schmid complex with coefficients in Milnor-Witt K-theory \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}, over Dedekind domains of finite type over \mathbf{Z}:
