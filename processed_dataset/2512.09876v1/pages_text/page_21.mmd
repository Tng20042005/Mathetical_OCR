Following classical lines,
it is possible to refine 2.2.8, by introducing *Euler classes*.
As we want a general formula, without relying on an underlying product structure,
we introduce an operation which plays the role of the multiplication by an Euler class.

###### Definition 2.3.1.

Let E\rightarrow X be a vector bundle of rank n, with zero section s:X\rightarrow E.
One defines, for any integer q and any line bundle \* over X, the *Euler class multiplication map*
as the following composite map:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \epsilon(E):=s^{!}s\_{\*}:A\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\rightarrow A\_{\*-n}(X,% \mathcal{M}\_{q+n},\det(-E)\otimes\*). |  |

One easily deduce from the properties of Gysin morphisms obtained in the previous section
the following properties, analogous to that of the Euler classes in Chow-Witt theory
over a field ([Fas08]):

1. (1)

   Invariance. Given an isomorphism \phi:E\xrightarrow{\sim}F,
   one gets: (\det(\phi)^{\vee})\_{\*}(\epsilon(F))=\epsilon(E).
2. (2)

   Base change. For p:Y\rightarrow X slci, p^{!}\circ\epsilon(E)=\epsilon(p^{-1}E)\circ p^{!}.
3. (3)

   Additivity. \epsilon(E\oplus F)=\epsilon(E)\circ\epsilon(F)
4. (4)

   Triviality. If E=\mathbf{A}^{1}\oplus E^{\prime}, \epsilon(E)=0.

One also deduces the following formula, as expected.

###### Proposition 2.3.2 (Excess intersection).

Consider a cartesian square as in 2.2.8
but we only assume that p is proper, and both f, g are slci.

In that case, there exists an excess intersection bundle \xi over Y^{\prime}, well-defined up to isomorphism,
of rank e=\dim(g)-\dim(f) and such that p^{!}\omega\_{g}=\det(\xi)\otimes\omega\_{f}.
We have, up to the canonical isomorphism induced by the previous isomorphism:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f^{!}\circ p\_{\*}=q\_{\*}\circ\epsilon(\xi)\circ g^{!} |  |

###### Proof.

One just reduces to the case where p is a regular closed immersion, comes back to the definition of Gysin morphisms
of regular closed immersions via deformation to the normal cone, use the functoriality properties of the latter
as described in the proof of [Dég04, Th. 2.1], and finally use 2.2.9
and 2.2.8.

### 2.4. From homology to cohomology; supports and \operatorname{SL}-orientation

Recall that we have associated to an MW-homodule \mathcal{M} a cocycle complex,
and the associated cohomological Chow-Witt groups with coefficients (1.3.7).
The conventions are chosen so that for any smoothable map f:Y\rightarrow X between
essentially slci S-schemes, the Gysin map of 2.2.5 induces the following
pullback map:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.4.0.a) |  | f^{\*}:A^{n}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L})\rightarrow A^{n}(Y,\mathcal{M}\_{q},% f^{\*}\mathcal{L}). |  |

In particular, cohomological Chow-Witt groups form a cohomology theory
over any of the site introduced in 2.2.7.
One can even consider a suitable notion of cohomology with supports,
generalizing [BCD{}^{+}20, Chap. 2, Def. 2.8]

###### Definition 2.4.1.

Let (X,Z) be a closed S-pair such that X is an essentially slci S-schemes,
Z an arbitrary closed subscheme of X. Let \mathcal{L} be a line bundle over X.
One defines the *cycle complex of (X,\mathcal{L}) with support in Z and coefficients in \mathcal{M}*
as:
