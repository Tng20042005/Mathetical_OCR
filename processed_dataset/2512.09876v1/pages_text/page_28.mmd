   Let X be an S-scheme essentially of finite type, and let x and y be two points on X. We define a map

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (3.3.1.d) |  | \partial^{x}\_{y}:M\_{\*}(x,\lambda\_{x})\to M\_{\*-1}(y,\lambda\_{y}) |  |

   as follows: let Z be the reduced Zariski closure of x in X, and if y\in Z^{(1)}, then the map (3.3.1.d) is defined as the map \partial\_{\mathcal{O}\_{Z,y}} in (3.3.1.c) associated to the 1-dimensional local domain \mathcal{O}\_{Z,y}; otherwise we put \partial^{x}\_{y}=0.

###### Definition 3.3.2.

Using the map (3.3.1.d) defined above, we will say that the MW-premodule M is a *Milnor-Witt cycle module* over S, or simply MW-module,
if the following conditions hold:

(FD):
:   Finite support of divisors. Let X be an S-scheme. Let \xi be a point on X and let \rho be an element of M(\xi). Then \partial^{\xi}\_{x}(\rho)=0 for all but finitely many x.

(C):
:   Closedness. Let X be a local, integral S-scheme of dimension 2, with generic point \xi and closed point x\_{0}. Then

    |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |  | 0=\sum\_{x\in X^{(1)}}\partial^{x}\_{x\_{0}}\circ\partial^{\xi}\_{x}:M\_{\*}(\xi,% \lambda\_{\xi})\to M\_{\*-2}(x\_{0},\lambda\_{x\_{0}}). |  |

The notion of a MW-module in 3.3.2 depends a priori on the choice of a pinning. The following result shows that it actually does not.

###### Proposition 3.3.3.

Let \lambda and \lambda^{\prime} be two pinnings on a base scheme S, then they define the same Milnor-Witt cycle modules.

It follows that MW-cycle modules are well defined over any scheme with a pinning, and does not depend on the choice of a pinning. For a scheme S with a pinning, we denote by \operatorname{MW-Homod}\_{S} (resp. \operatorname{MW-Mod}\_{S}) the category of MW-cycle homodules (resp. modules) over S.

###### Proof.

It is straightforward to check that the two pinnings \lambda and \mathcal{L}\otimes\lambda (see 3.1.7 for the definition of the latter) define the same MW-cycle modules.

If X is an integral local scheme and \lambda,\lambda^{\prime} are two pinnings on X, then there exists a line \mathcal{L} bundle on X such that \lambda^{\prime}\simeq\mathcal{L}\otimes\lambda. Indeed, every line bundle over a local scheme is trivial, and a trivialization is uniquely determined by a global invertible section. Let \xi be the generic point of X, and the isomorphism \lambda\_{\xi}\simeq\lambda^{\prime}\_{\xi} determines an invertible section s at \xi.
Then the set of points of X at which s is invertible is stable under immediate specializations (use the property that a pinning has sections over all discrete valuation rings and argue as in 3.3.1) and contains \xi, and therefore agrees with the whole X since X is integral. It follows that s defines a global invertible section on X, which induces an isomorphism \lambda^{\prime}\simeq\mathcal{L}\otimes\lambda.
