where we have used the canonical isomorphism \pi^{-1}(\omega\_{Z/X})=\omega\_{N\_{Z}X/Z} of line bundles.
Denote by r\_{Z/X}=(\pi^{!})^{-1} its inverse.

###### Definition 2.2.3.

With the previous notations, we define the map

i^{!}:A\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\to A\_{\*-n}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\omega\_{i}%
\otimes\*)

by putting i^{!}=r\_{Z/X}\circ J\_{Z/X} and call it the Gysin morphism of i.

###### 2.2.4.

Let X and Y be two S-schemes and let f:Y\to X be an slci morphism. Consider a factorization
\xymatrix{Y\ar[r]^{i}&P\ar[r]^{p}X} of f into a regular closed immersion
followed by a smooth morphism. As in [Fel20, Section 10], we see that the composition i^{!}p^{!} does not depend on the chosen factorization.

###### Definition 2.2.5.

Keeping the previous notations and let d be the relative dimension of f.
We define the Gysin morphism associated to f as the morphism
(where we have made twists explicit)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f^{!}=i^{!}\circ p^{!}:A\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M},\mathcal{L})\to A\_{\*+d}(Y,\mathcal{% M},\omega\_{f}\otimes f^{-1}\mathcal{L}). |  |

###### Proposition 2.2.6.

Consider slci morphisms \xymatrix{Z\ar[r]^{g}&Y\ar[r]^{f}X} such that
g\circ f is smoothable, thus slci.
Then

g^{!}\circ f^{!}=(f\circ g)^{!}.

###### Proof.

As in [Fel20, Prop. 10.12]. ∎

###### 2.2.7.

The drawback of working with slci (recall: smoothable lci) morphisms is that they
are not necessarily stable under composition.
If one wants an appropriate site \mathscr{S}\_{S} of S-schemes
and such that every morphism is slci, one can consider the following ones:

1. (1)

   the site of smoothable separate (e.g. quasi-projective in the sense of
   Hartshorne) S-schemes with slci morphisms;
2. (2)

   the site of separated (or affine) smooth S-schemes.

In any of those cases, morphisms in the underlying site admit a canonical factorization
into a regular closed immersion followed by a smooth morphism,
using the S-graph construction.

###### Proposition 2.2.8 (Base change for slci morphisms).

Consider a cartesian square of S-schemes

\xymatrix@=10pt{Y^{\prime}\ar[r]^{g}\ar[d]\_{q}&X^{\prime}\ar[d]^{p}\\
Y\ar[r]\_{f}X}

with p proper and f slci.
Assume that the square is transversal in the sense that the morphism g is slci and
the canonical map p^{!}\omega\_{f}\to\omega\_{g} is an isomorphism.
We have (up to the canonical isomorphism induced by the previous isomorphism):

f^{!}\circ p\_{\*}=q\_{\*}\circ g^{!}

which is compatible with horizontal and vertical compositions of transversal squares.

###### Proof.

As in [Fel20, Prop. 10.13].
∎

Applying the above proposition to the case p=i is a closed immersion, one gets:

###### Corollary 2.2.9.

The localization long exact sequence (1.5.8.a) associated with a closed immersion i
is functorial with respect to pullbacks along slci morphism transversal to i.
