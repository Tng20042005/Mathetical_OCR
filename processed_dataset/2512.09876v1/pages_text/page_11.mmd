A morphism a:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}^{\prime} of MW-homodules is a natural transformation which commutes with the data 1.1.1,…, 1.1.1.

In particular, MW-homodules over a base scheme S form a category which is denoted by \operatorname{MW-Homod}\_{S}.
One can easily check that \operatorname{MW-Homod}\_{S} is in fact an abelian category.444It is actually
a Grothendieck abelian symmetric monoidal category. However, as in the case of a base field
([Dég11], [Fel21a]),
this result is quite involved and we leave it for a later work.

###### 1.2.6.

In the following, let F be a field over S and {\mathbf{A}\_{F}^{1}=\operatorname{Spec}F[t]} be the affine line over \operatorname{Spec}F with function field F(t). Moreover, we fix n an integer and \* a line bundle over S.

###### Proposition 1.2.7.

Let \mathcal{M} be a MW-homodule over S. With the previous notations, the following properties hold.

(H’):
:   Homotopy
    property for \mathbf{A}^{1}. We have a short exact sequence

    \xymatrix@C=10pt@R=20pt{0\ar[r]&\mathcal{M}\_{n}(F,\*)\ar[r]^{-}{\operatorname{%
    res}}\mathcal{M}\_{n}(F(t),\*)\ar[r]^{-}d\bigoplus\_{x\in{(\mathbf{A}\_{F}^{1})}\_{%
    (1)}}\mathcal{M}\_{n-1}(\kappa(x),\*)\ar[r]0}

    where the map d is defined in 1.2.4.

(RC’):
:   Reciprocity for curves. Let X be a proper curve over F with generic point \xi\_{X}. Then

    \xymatrix{\mathcal{M}\_{n}(\xi\_{X},\*)\ar[r]^{-}d&\displaystyle\bigoplus\_{x\in X%
    \_{(1)}}\mathcal{M}\_{n-1}(x,\*)\ar[r]^{-}c\mathcal{M}\_{n-1}(F,\*)}

    is a complex, that is c\circ d=0 (where c={\sum\_{x}\operatorname{cores}\_{\kappa(x)/F}}).

###### Remark 1.2.8.

Axiom 1.2.2 enables one to write down the differential d of the soon-to-be-defined complex C\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M},\*), axiom 1.2.2 guarantees that d\circ d=0, property 1.2.7 yields the homotopy invariance of the Chow groups A\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M},\*) and finally 1.2.7 is needed to establish proper pushforward.

### 1.3. The associated cycle complex

###### 1.3.1.

Let \mathcal{M} and \mathcal{M}^{\prime} be two MW-homodules over S, let X and Y be two schemes and let U\subset X and V\subset Y be subsets. Fix an integer n and a line bundle \*. Given a morphism

\alpha:\displaystyle\bigoplus\_{x\in U}\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*)\to\displaystyle%
\bigoplus\_{y\in V}\mathcal{M}\_{n}^{\prime}(y,\*),

we write \alpha^{x}\_{y}:\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*)\to\mathcal{M}\_{n}^{\prime}(y,\*) for the components of \alpha.

###### 1.3.2.

Change of coefficients
Let \alpha:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}^{\prime} be a morphism between two MW-homodules, let X be a scheme over S and U\subset X a subset. We put

\alpha\_{\#}:\bigoplus\_{x\in U}\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*)\to\bigoplus\_{x\in U}%
\mathcal{M}\_{n}^{\prime}(x,\*)

where (\alpha\_{\#})^{x}\_{x}=\alpha\_{\kappa(x)} and (\alpha\_{\#})^{x}\_{y}=0 for x\neq y.

###### 1.3.3.

Let \mathcal{M} be a MW-homodule, let X be a scheme with a line bundle denoted by \* and p be an integer. Recall that X\_{(p)} is the set of (p)-dimensional points of X. Define

C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M},\*)=\displaystyle\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}\mathcal{M}\_{n}(x,\*)

and
