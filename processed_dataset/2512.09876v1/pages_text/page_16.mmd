Same as [Ros96, Proposition 4.6]. The first assertion comes from 1.5.1.1 and 1.1.1, the second from 1.1.1, 1.5.1.3, 1.5.6.1 and 1.1.1 (note that the proof is actually much easier in our case since there are no multiplicities to consider). The third assertion follows from the definitions and Proposition 1.5.3.2, the fourth from the fact that d\circ d=0.

###### 1.5.7.

According to the previous section (see Proposition 1.5.6), the morphisms f\_{\*} for f proper, g^{\*} for g essentially smooth, multiplication by [a\_{1},\dots,a\_{n}] or \eta, \partial^{U}\_{Y} (anti)commute with the differentials, and thus define maps on the homology groups.

###### 1.5.8.

Let (Z,i,X,j,U) be a boundary triple. We can split the complex C\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*) as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | C\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)=C\_{\*}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\oplus C\_{\*}(U,\mathcal{M% }\_{q},\*) |  |

so that one get the associated *localization long exact sequence*:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.5.8.a) |  | \xymatrix@=10pt{\dots\ar[r]^{-}\partial&A\_{p}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[r]^{-}{i% \_{\*}}A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[r]^{-}{j^{!}}A\_{p}(U,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[% r]^{-}{\partial}A\_{p-1}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[r]^{-}{i\_{\*}}\dots} |  |

One deduces that Chow-Witt groups with coefficients satisfy the following form
of cdh-descent:

###### Proposition 1.5.9.

Consider, as above, an MW-homodule \mathcal{M} over S.
Then any cdh-distinguished square777Recall: \Delta is cartesian, i is a closed immersion, p is proper and an isomorphism over X-Z.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \xymatrix@=10pt{T\ar^{k}[r]\ar\_{q}[d]\ar@{}|\Delta[rd]&Y\ar^{p}[d]\\ Z\ar\_{i}[r]X} |  |

is sent to a homotopy cartesian square by the covariant functor C\_{\*}(-,\mathcal{M},\*). In particular,
one gets a long exact sequence:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \xymatrix@=20pt{\dots\ar[r]^{-}\partial&A\_{p}(T,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[r]^{-}{q% \_{\*}-k\_{\*}}A\_{p}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\oplus A\_{p}(Y,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[r]^{% -}{i\_{\*}+p\_{\*}}A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[r]^{-}{\partial}\dots} |  |
