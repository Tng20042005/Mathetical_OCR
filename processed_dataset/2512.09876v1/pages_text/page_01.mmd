###### Abstract.

We introduce a general theory of Milnor–Witt cycle modules
over a base scheme S, extending simultaneously Rost’s classical cycle modules and Feld’s Milnor-Witt theory over fields,
and yielding a Borel-Moore type intersection theory with quadratic coefficients.
We define *homological* Milnor-Witt modules and their Rost-Schmid complexes,
establish proper pushforwards, smooth pullbacks, Gysin morphisms
and duality, and introduce *pinnings* allowing a cohomological version
and a duality equivalence between the two.
As applications, we construct Chow-Witt groups for possibly singular S-schemes,
satisfying localization, homotopy invariance and canonical duality.
When S is regular of dimension at most 1,
we prove generalized Bloch formulas identifying these groups with unramified Milnor-Witt cohomology,
hence establishing their representability in motivic homotopy theory.
For 1-dimensional arithmetic schemes, we compute homology groups of the Rost-Schmid complex associated with Milnor-Witt K-theory in the regular case, and deduce a comparison between Chow-Witt and Chow groups, as well as finiteness results in the general case, in analogy with the Bass-Tate conjecture.
This work provides the cycle-theoretic foundation of an ongoing project on
describing perverse homotopy t-structures via Milnor-Witt modules.
