This follows from the \delta-niveau spectral sequence for K-theory, as recalled in 1.3.6:
the identification of the E\_{1}-term with the complex computing Chow(-Witt) groups of X with coefficients
in \mathcal{K}\_{\*} implies the following computation of the E\_{2}-term:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E^{2,\delta}\_{p,q}=A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{K}\_{q}). |  |

Both assertions follow from the fact the \delta-niveau spectral sequence is concentrated in the
region p\in[\delta\_{-}(X),\delta\_{+}(X)].
∎

In particular, by Lemma 4.5.8, the property \big{(}\text{FT}^{\mathbf{Z}}\big{)} for Quillen K-theory \mathcal{K}\_{\*} implies the Bass conjecture in general. Conversely, in the 1-dimensional case, one deduces from known cases of the Bass conjecture the following corollary.

###### Corollary 4.5.9.

Let X be a scheme of finite type over \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{Z} of dimension at most 1. For example, X can be the spectrum of an order in a number ring, or a curve over a finite field.
Then the MW-module \mathcal{K}\_{\*} satisfies the property \big{(}\text{FT}^{\mathbf{Z}}\_{X}\big{)}.

###### Remark 4.5.10.

Lemma 4.5.8 can be extended to any of the MW-homodules of 1.3.6, provided one considers the whole family of associated MW-homodules.
The case of Quillen K-theory is simpler: indeed, Bott periodicity implies that the twisted Borel-Moore theory associated to K-theory is single-graded instead of being bigraded, and therefore there is a single associated MW-homodule up to shifts of degree.

###### Remark 4.5.11.

Compared to the Bass conjecture 4.5.2, there are reasons to believe in the a priori stronger property \big{(}\text{FT}^{\mathbf{Z}}\big{)} for Quillen K-theory \mathcal{K}\_{\*}. For example, let X be a scheme of finite type over \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{Z} of dimension 2. While not directly implied by the Bass conjecture, all the Chow groups \operatorname{CH}\_{i}(X)=A\_{i}(X,\mathcal{K}\_{i}) are known to be finitely generated for i=0,1,2. Indeed, by the localization sequence 1.5.8 (or [Ful98, Proposition 1.8]) and noetherian induction,
we may assume X is in addition regular.
Then we can use the following known results:

* •

  \operatorname{CH}\_{2}(X)=\mathbf{Z}^{n}, where n is the number of irreducible components of X of dimension 2;
* •

  \operatorname{CH}\_{1}(X)=\operatorname{Pic}(X) is finitely generated, by a theorem of Samuel
  (see [Kah06]);
* •

  \operatorname{CH}\_{0}(X) is finitely generated, by a theorem of Kato and Saito (see [KS83]).

As a further evidence for Conjecture 4.5.5, we use the computations of the previous section to show that it is true in dimension at most 1:

###### Theorem 4.5.12.

The MW-modules \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}, \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}, \operatorname{I}^{\*}, \mathcal{GW}\_{\*}, \mathcal{W}\_{\*} and \mathcal{K}\_{\*} over \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{Z}
are all homologically finite
in dimension less or equal to 1.
In other words, they satisfy the property \big{(}\text{FT}^{\mathbf{Z}}\_{X}\big{)} for any scheme X of finite type over \mathbf{Z} of dimension at most 1.

###### Proof.

By the localization sequence 1.5.8 and noetherian induction, we are reduced to the case where X is regular and affine.
The case of \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*} (resp. \operatorname{K}^{W}\_{\*}, \operatorname{W}, \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}) follows from the computation
of Proposition 4.4.14 (resp. Proposition 4.4.17; Theorem 4.4.20)
and the finiteness of the class group of R, 4.4.7(2) for \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(R), and [BT73, II, §1, Cor. (1.2)].
The case of \mathcal{K}\_{\*} is Corollary 4.5.9, which implies the case of \mathcal{GW}\_{\*}.
∎

###### 4.5.13.

We end this section by proving the homological finiteness for \mathcal{W}\_{\*,\mathbb{Z}[1/2]}\simeq\operatorname{I}^{\*}\_{\mathbb{Z}[1/2]}:

###### Proposition 4.5.14.

Let X be a scheme of finite type over \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{Z} and let \mathcal{L} be a line bundle over X.

Then for any integers n and p, the group A\_{p}(X,\operatorname{I}^{\*}\{n\},\mathcal{L})\_{\mathbb{Z}[1/2]} is a finitely generated \mathbb{Z}[1/2]-module.
In other words, the MW-module \operatorname{I}^{\*} satisfies \big{(}\text{FT}^{\mathbb{Z}[1/2]}\big{)}.

###### Proof.

By the localization sequence (1.5.8.a) and noetherian induction, we may assume X quasi-projective over \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{Z}, and that \mathcal{L} is trivial.
Denote by f:X\to\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{Z} the structural morphism.
After inverting 2, the group A\_{p}(X,\operatorname{I}^{\*}\{n\})\_{\mathbb{Z}[1/2]} agrees with the Borel-Moore real étale homology H\_{n}(X\_{r},f^{!}\m
