One can always twist these groups by a line bundle \mathcal{L} over X:
C\_{p}(X,M\_{q},\hat{\lambda}\otimes\mathcal{L}), where \hat{\lambda}\otimes\mathcal{L}=(\mathcal{L}\otimes\lambda,\delta) with the notation of 3.1.7.
One can also describe the functoriality of these complexes or their homology as follows,
for \pi:X^{\prime}\rightarrow X proper and f:Y\rightarrow X essentially slci:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\pi\_{\*}: | \displaystyle A\_{p}(X^{\prime},M\_{q},\pi^{\*}\hat{\lambda})\rightarrow A\_{p}(X,% M\_{q},\hat{\lambda}), |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle f^{!}: | \displaystyle A\_{p}(X,M\_{\*},\hat{\lambda})\rightarrow A\_{p}(Y,M\_{\*},f^{!}\hat{% \lambda}), |  |

where: \pi^{\*}\hat{\lambda}=(\pi^{\*}\lambda,\delta|\_{X^{\prime}}), f^{!}\hat{\lambda}=(f^{!}\lambda,d(f)+\delta|\_{Y}),
with the notation of 3.1.7, and d(f) is the Zariski local function on Y given by the dimension of the fibers.

### 3.5. Oriented Milnor-Witt cycle modules

The particular case of 3.4.2 of \eta-trivial objects is fundamental.
The following lemma is obvious, as the symbols \langle u\rangle\in\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{0}(E) becomes equal to 1 in \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{0}(E).

###### Lemma 3.5.1.

We have that a MW-premodule M (resp. MW-prehomodule \mathcal{M})
is \eta-trivial if and only if for any field E, the action of \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}(E) on M(E) (resp. \mathcal{M}(E))
factors through \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}(E).

If these conditions hold, for any line bundle \mathcal{L} over E, one gets a canonical identification:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5.1.a) |  | M(E,\mathcal{L})=M(E)\text{ resp. }\mathcal{M}(E,\mathcal{L})=\mathcal{M}(E). |  |

###### Definition 3.5.2.

If the equivalent conditions of the first sentence of the previous lemma holds,
we will say that M (resp. \mathcal{M}) is *orientable*.
We also use the terminology *Milnor cycle pre(ho)module*,
of simply M-module (resp. M-homodule).

###### 3.5.3.

Thanks to 3.5.1, the axioms defining a M-premodule M are simpler
than those defining a MW-premodule. They are in fact a simplification (but essentially equivalent) of Rost’s axioms
for cycle modules.
First, the lemma shows that the data (D3) is equivalent of \mathbf{Z}-graded \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}(E)-module structure on M(E).
Second, given the canonical trivialization of twists one can rewrite some of the functorialities of M
as follows:

(d2):
:   For a finite morphism of S-fields \phi:E\to F, we have a map of degree 0

    |  |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | (3.5.3.a) |  | \displaystyle\phi^{!}:M(F)\to M(E); |  |

(d4):
:   For an S-field \operatorname{Spec}E and an S-valuation v on E, we have a map of degree -1

    |  |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | (3.5.3.b) |  | \displaystyle\partial\_{v}:M(E)\to M(\kappa(v)). |  |

One can check that all the relations 3.2.1 though 3.2.1 continue to hold with the new functorialities 3.5.3.a and 3.5.3.b.

###### 3.5.4.

With the previous simplification of the axioms for an orientable MW-premodule M,
is it possible to extend the definition of 3.3 over a base scheme S,
without requiring the existence of a pinning.
Indeed, under this hypothesis we can define general residue maps as follows:
