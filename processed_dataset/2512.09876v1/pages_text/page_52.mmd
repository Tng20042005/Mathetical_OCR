where the sum runs over the points y/x\in T/Z, and N\_{y/x} denotes the norm map of the finite field extension \kappa(y)/\kappa(x).

###### Proof.

As X is Nagata, the normalization map p is finite. Since X is 1-dimensional Noetherian reduced, its singular locus Z has positive codimension. The first claim follows.
Assume that \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(\widetilde{X})=0.
According to (4.4.3.a), one gets: \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X)\simeq A\_{0}(X,\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{2}), \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(\widetilde{X})\simeq A\_{0}(\tilde{X},\operatorname{K}^{M%
}\_{2}).
The square \Delta is a cdh-square, so it induces a long exact sequence for Chow groups with coefficients in the cycle module \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*} over X
according to 1.5.9.
The end of this long exact sequence is precisely the desired exact sequence.
∎

###### Example 4.4.10.

If A is an order in a number ring \mathcal{O}\_{F}, then one has \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(A)=0. Indeed, the ideal \mathfrak{f} of Z (resp. T) in X=\operatorname{Spec}(A) (resp. \widetilde{X}=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}\_{F}))
corresponds to the conductor of A in \mathcal{O}\_{F}. One concludes by applying Lemma 4.4.9 to this situation, using the case of \mathcal{O}\_{F} in 4.4.7, the surjectivity of q and the fact that the norm map N\_{y/x} is surjective for extensions of finite fields.

In contrast, the group \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(A) vanishes if and only if \mathfrak{f} is square free.

###### Corollary 4.4.11.

Let A\subset\mathcal{O}\_{F} be an order in a number ring, X=\operatorname{Spec}(A). Then the forgetful map (4.4.4.b) is an isomorphism. In particular, for a finite set S of finite places of F, and any invertible \mathcal{O}\_{F,S}-module L, we have a canonical isomorphism

###### Proof.

The first (resp. second) condition of 4.4.6 is true according to [MH73, Chap. V] (resp. 4.4.10).
∎

In fact, more original examples follow from 4.4.6:

###### Corollary 4.4.12.

Let S=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}\_{F}) be the spectrum of a number ring, \mathfrak{p}\subset\mathcal{O}\_{F} a prime,
and U=S-\{\mathfrak{p}\}. Consider one of the following situations:

1. (1)

   Consider the non-separated (*i.e.* non-affine in this case) Dedekind scheme X=S\sqcup\_{U}S. This is the spectrum of a number
   ring with the point \mathfrak{p} doubled.
2. (2)

   Consider the *pinching* X=S\sqcup\_{\{\mathfrak{p}\}}S=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}\_{F}\times\_{%
   \kappa(\mathfrak{p})}\mathcal{O}\_{F}) as defined in [Fer03].
   This is a normal crossing scheme made of two copies of the Dedekind scheme S glued at the point \mathfrak{p}.
