## Introduction

Intersection theory is one of the historical pillars of algebraic geometry.
Starting from Bézout’s theorem, the notion of intersection multiplicities
has been a major focus of the early developments of the subject,
evolving into the well-established theory of Chow groups developed during the second half of the twentieth century.
More recently, motivated by the Gersten conjecture,
Bloch’s formula and the horizon of mixed motives,
Rost introduced the theory of *cycle modules* [Ros96] for schemes over a field.
This provides a powerful framework for enriching Chow groups with coefficients
coming from Milnor K-theory or more general cohomological functors,
and opens the way to new homological methods in intersection theory,
such as localization long exact sequences and spectral sequences.

Subsequent developments by Schmid, Barge-Morel and Fasel showed that
Chow groups admit a *quadratic refinement*,
now called the *Chow-Witt groups* [Fas08, FS09],
in which degrees and intersection multiplicities are valued in the Grothendieck–Witt ring GW,
and whose cohomological counterparts encode subtle quadratic and arithmetic information, allowing numerous applications to Euler classes,
quadratic enumerative geometry, and real or hermitian phenomena.
Over a perfect base field k,
a quadratic analogue of Rost’s cycle modules has been defined by Feld in [Fel20].

The aim of this paper is to introduce a general theory of
*Milnor-Witt cycle (ho)modules* over a base scheme,
and to deduce from it a Borel-Moore type intersection theory extending the
Chow-Witt groups to singular and arithmetic schemes.
Our approach extends simultaneously Rost’s classical theory of cycle modules and
Feld’s theory of Milnor-Witt cycle modules over a field,
and produces a framework of an intersection theory with quadratic coefficients, without any base field.
In particular, we give a cycle-theoretic definition of Chow-Witt groups for possibly singular or mixed characteristic schemes, together with expected functorialities.
