_{0}(X,\operatorname{K}^{W}\_{2},\mathcal{L}),
and the isomorphism \underline{\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{1}/2}(R)\simeq\underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M%
}\_{1}(R)/2. The latter follows from definitions
and an easy application of the snake lemma. The exact sequence (4.4.17.d) finally follows
from the definitions of the unramified sheaves \underline{\operatorname{I}}^{2}, \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M} and another application of the
snake lemma.

Let us consider the computation (4.4.17.e).
The identification (1) follows from the vanishing \operatorname{I}^{2}(k) for a finite field k.
The identification (2) follows from he separation of I-adic filtration of the Witt ring \operatorname{W}(K,L),
and the Milnor conjecture proved by Voevodsky:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{I}^{q}(K,\mathcal{L})/\operatorname{I}^{q+1}(K,\mathcal{L})=H^{q% }(K,\mu\_{2})=(\mathbf{Z}/2)^{r}. |  |

See [CP84], Theorem I.2.5 and the discussion that follows.
Finally, the vanishing when K is of the characteristic 2 case follows from the Milnor conjucture,
this time due to Kato, and the vanishing of H^{q}(K,\mu\_{2}) for q>1.
∎

###### 4.4.18.

The previous result yields an explicit computation of the unramified Witt group
\underline{\operatorname{W}}(R,L) in terms of the units of R modulo square, the number of real places of K,
and the group \underline{\operatorname{k}}^{M}\_{2}(R). Thanks to the purity theorem of Balmer and Walter,
[BW02, Th. 10.1], this immediately yields the same computation for the symmetric Witt
group \operatorname{W}(R,L) when R is a \mathbf{Z}[1/2]-algebra.
In fact, one can obtain this computation without the restriction to characteristic
not two.

###### Theorem 4.4.19 (Purity for symmetric Witt groups).

Let X be a regular scheme of dimension less or equal to one,
and \mathcal{L} be a line bundle over X.

Then the canonical map:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{W}(X,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\underline{\operatorname{W}}(X,% \mathcal{L}) |  |

where the left hand-side is the \mathcal{L}-twisted (symmetric)
Witt group of X and the right hand-side was is the unramified Witt group
(see 4.3.4 applied to the MW-homodule \operatorname{W}),
is an isomorphism.

In particular, the computations of the preceding proposition can be extended
to the (symmetric) Witt group of an arbitrary regular scheme of dimension 1
and of finite type over \mathbf{Z}. One can also avoid the regular assumption
by using the coherent symmetric Witt group.

###### Proof.

The following proof is valid in arbitrary characteristic, contrary to [BW02].
According to [CDH{}^{+}20, Ex. 1.3.7],
one gets higher symmetric Witt groups W^{[i]}\_{n} — also known as L-groups according
to *op. cit.* —
for arbitrary schemes together satisfying the localization
long exact sequence for regular schemes. Our bigraduation follows the convention of
Schlichting’s higher (Grothendieck-)Witt groups. Note that with this notation,
one gets a periodicity result: W^{[i]}\_{n}=W^{[i+1]}\_{n+1}.

For a regular scheme X, one deduces from the devissage result of [CDH{}^{+}20, Th. 2.2.4]
that the coniveau spectral sequence has the following E\_{1}-term: E\_{1}^{p,q}=\oplus\_{x\in X^{(p)}}\operatorname{W}^{[-p]}\_{-p-q}(\kappa(x),%
\omega\_{x}\otimes\mathcal{L}\_{x}),
and converges to \operatorname{W}\_{-p-q}(X,
