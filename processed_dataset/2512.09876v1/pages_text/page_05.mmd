(see Section 4.5).

###### Theorem B (4.5.12).

Let M be one of the MW-modules in \{\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*},\operatorname{K}^{W}\_{\*},\operatorname{W},%
\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*},\operatorname{GW},\operatorname{K}\_{\*}\} over \mathbf{Z}. Then for any scheme X of finite type over \mathbf{Z} of dimension \leqslant 1, for all pair of integers p,q, and every line bundle \mathcal{L} over X, the group A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L}) is a finitely generated abelian group.

In other words, the homology groups of the Rost-Schmid complexes of a finite type \mathbf{Z}-scheme of dimension at most 1 with coefficients in all those MW-modules are finitely generated
abelian groups. We may hope that Theorem B, together with the whole theory developed in this paper, notably the spectral sequence 2.1.2, will shed light on deep finiteness conjectures such as the Bass conjecture (see Conjecture 4.5.5).

Although our constructions are purely algebraic,
they can be viewed as a first layer of cohomological theories represented in the motivic homotopy theory.
Indeed, they provide the cycle-theoretic framework of a broader
program — outlined in [DFJ22] — aimed at describing the heart of
the Ayoub-Bondarko-Déglise perverse homotopy t-structure
in terms of Milnor–Witt homodules.
The present work should therefore be viewed as a self-contained but
foundational step toward that long-term objective.

### Outline of the paper

Section 1 develops the category of homological MW-modules and the associated
Rost–Schmid complex together with the four basic maps and their compatibilities.
Section 2 proves the homotopy invariance and constructs the Gysin morphisms,
excess intersection and base-change formulas, as well as the SL-orientation.
Section 3 introduces pinnings, defines cohomological MW-modules and establishes
the duality equivalence.
Section 4 contains the applications: Chow-Witt groups over arbitrary bases,
unramified sheaves and Bloch formulas, explicit arithmetic computations, and
finiteness theorems.

#### Future work

As already mentioned, a more general motivic interpretation will be developed in subsequent papers,
towards the conjecture of Ayoub.
In a forthcoming one ([FJ25]), the second and third-named authors will define and compute quadratic lengths, and construct pullback maps on Rost-Schmid complexes associated to flat Gorenstein morphisms.
Moreover, the formalism of the present paper is used in [Fel22] to study birational invariants.

## Notation and conventions

###### 0.0.1.

Algebraic geometry conventions.
We will work exclusively with excellent schemes in the sense of [GD67, §7.8.5].111This is used to ensure that DVRs have no defect in the sense of [Dég25, Prop. 5.3.12]. We expect to remove this assumption in a subsequent paper.
We use the following conventions: a morphism f:X\rightarrow S of schemes is:

* •

  *essentially of finite type*
  if f is the projective limit of a cofiltered system (f\_{i})\_{i\in I} of morphisms of finite type
  with affine and étale transition maps;
* •

  *smoothable* if it admits a factorization X\xrightarrow{i}P\xrightarrow{p}S such that
  i is a closed immersion and p is smooth;
* •

  *slci* if it is smoothable and a local complete intersection (*i.e.* it admits a global factorization f=p\circ i,
  p smooth and i a regular closed immersion);
* •

  *essentially slci* if it is a limit of slci morphisms with étale transition maps.

Given a morphism of schemes f:Y\rightarrow X, we let \mathrm{L}\_{f} be its cotangent complex,
an object of \operatorname{D}^{b}\_{\mathrm{coh}}(Y),
and when the latter is perfect (e.g. if f is essentially slci), we let \omega\_{f} be its determinant.
When S is clear from the context, we simply write \omega\_{X}=\omega\_{f}.
In this paper, all schemes are assumed to be excellent noetherian and finite dimensional, and equipped with a dimension function \delta.
