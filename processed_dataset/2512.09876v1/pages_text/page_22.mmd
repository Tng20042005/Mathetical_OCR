|  | C^{p}\_{Z}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L})=\bigoplus\_{x\in(X^{(p)}\cap Z)}% \mathcal{M}\_{q-p}(\kappa(x),\omega\_{f}\otimes\mathcal{L}^{\vee}) |  |

seen as a subcomplex of C^{\*}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L}).
We let A^{\*}\_{Z}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L}) be the associated cohomology groups,
called *Chow-Witt group with support in Z* and coefficients in \mathcal{M}.

It follows from this definition that the duality isomorphism
(1.3.7.b) can be extended to a version with supports:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (2.4.1.a) |  | A^{p}\_{Z}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L})\simeq A\_{d-p}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_{q-d},% \omega\_{X}|\_{Z}\otimes\mathcal{L}^{\vee}|\_{Z}) |  |

By construction, we have the usual long exact sequence of cohomology
with support, which corresponds by using duality to the localization
long exact sequence (1.5.8.a).
Finally, cohomology with support allows us to express the fact that
Chow-Witt groups with coefficients are *canonically* \operatorname{SL}-oriented,
in the sense of Panin and Walter. As in the previous section,
we give a formulation which is valid without a product structure.

###### Proposition 2.4.2.

Consider the above notation.
Let X be an essentially slci S-scheme, and \pi:E\rightarrow X
be a vector bundle of rank r over X.
Then there exists a canonical *Thom isomorphism*:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \tau\_{E}:A^{p-r}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q-r},\mathcal{L}\otimes\det(-E))\simeq A^{p}\_{% X}(E,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\pi^{\*}\mathcal{L}) |  |

which satisfies the properties of the Thom classes of an \operatorname{SL}-oriented theory
(see e.g. [PW18, Def. 3.1, Th. 3.2]).

Indeed, \tau\_{E} is given by the following composite of duality isomorphisms,
where d is the dimension of X:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | A^{p}\_{X}(E,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\pi^{\*}\mathcal{L})\simeq A\_{d+r-p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_% {q-d-r},\omega\_{E}|\_{X}\otimes\mathcal{L}^{\vee})\simeq A\_{p-r}(X,\mathcal{M}\_% {q-r},\mathcal{L}\otimes\det(-E)). |  |

Moreover, one further deduces from 1.1.4 that cohomological
Chow-Witt groups with coefficients are \operatorname{SL}^{c}-oriented: an
orientation \varphi:\det(E)\xrightarrow{\sim}\mathcal{L}^{\otimes 2} of E/X
induces a canonical Thom isomorphism:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \tau\_{\varphi}:A^{p}\_{X}(E,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\pi^{\*}\mathcal{L})\simeq A^{p-r}(X% ,\mathcal{M}\_{q-r},\mathcal{L}\otimes\det(-E))\simeq A^{p-r}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q-% r},\mathcal{L}). |  |

One can therefore apply all the results of \operatorname{SL}^{c} and \operatorname{Sp}-oriented theories.
This includes a symplectic projective bundle theorem, an action of Borel classes,
(see [PW18], formulated without ring structure as above). With further work,
one can even get a projective bundle theorem as in [Fas20, Th. 4.2].

###### Remark 2.4.3.

Over an essentially slci S-scheme X,
the previous Thom isomorphisms can be used to define the Euler class multiplication map of 2.3.1.
Indeed, with the above notations, \mathcal{L}=\det(E), s:X\rightarrow E
the zero section, one deduces from definitions that the
following composite is the Euler class multiplication map:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle A\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M},\*) | \displaystyle\stackrel{{\scriptstyle(1)}}{{\simeq}}A^{\*}(X,\mathcal{M},\det(E)% \otimes\*^{\vee}){\xrightarrow{\t
