###### Corollary 4.3.8.

Consider the assumptions and notation of Theorem 4.3.5.
Then the homotopy module \underline{M} defines an object, denoted by \mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S}, of the (Nisnevich-local) \mathbf{A}^{1}-derived category \operatorname{D}\_{\mathbf{A}^{1}}(S).
The object \mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S} admits a canonical \operatorname{SL}-orientation.191919*i.e.*
an \mathbf{MSL}-module structure.

Let p:X\rightarrow S be a morphism of schemes essentially of finite type,
and v be a virtual vector bundle over X of rank r.
If X is essentially smooth over S,
one has the following canonical isomorphism:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | H^{n,v}(X,\mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S}):=\big{[}\Sigma^{\infty}\mathbf{Z}\_{S}(X% ),\mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S}\otimes\operatorname{Th}\_{S}(v)[n]\big{]}\_{% \operatorname{D}\_{\mathbf{A}^{1}}(S)}\simeq A^{n+r}\big{(}X,M\_{r},\det(v)^{% \vee}\big{)}, |  |

which is natural with respect to contravariant functoriality and Gysin morphisms.
Moreover, in any case, one has a canonical isomorphism:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | H\_{n,v}^{BM}(X/S,\mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S}):=\big{[}\Sigma^{\infty}% \operatorname{Th}\_{X}(v)[n],p^{!}(\mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S})\big{]}\_{% \operatorname{D}\_{\mathbf{A}^{1}}(S)}\simeq A\_{n+r}\big{(}X,M\_{-r},\det(v)\big% {)}, |  |

which is natural with respect to proper covariance and Gysin maps.

###### Proof.

The first isomorphism, at least with v=0 follows from Theorem 4.3.5.
In fact, replacing \Sigma^{\infty}X in the formula with \Sigma^{\infty}\mathbf{Z}(X/X-Z),
for any closed subscheme Z\subset X, one even obtain an isomorphism with the Chow-Witt group
of X with support in Z and coefficients in \operatorname{\mathcal{D}}\_{\lambda}(M), as defined in 2.4.1..
Then the first isomorphism follow from 2.4.2.
This also shows that \mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S} is \operatorname{SL}-orientable.
To get the second isomorphism, one uses that both A\_{\*}(-,M,\*) and H\_{\*\*}^{BM}(-/S,\mathbf{H}\underline{M}\_{S})
satisfies duality (1.3.7.c) and admit localization exact sequences (1.5.8.a).
∎

###### Example 4.3.9.

As a particular case, we obtain the representability of Chow-Witt groups,
Chow groups, unramified Witt groups and unramified I^{\*}-cohomology over an S
as in the previous theorem, in the stable \mathbf{A}^{1}-derived category, and therefore
in the motivic stable homotopy category.
This was previously known over a field ([Mor12]),
and for Witt groups over a Dedekind \mathbf{Z}[1/2]-scheme by [Bac22].

###### Corollary 4.3.10.

Under the assumptions and notation of Theorem 4.3.5, one has exact sequences of homotopy modules over S:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.3.10.a) |  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow\underline{\operatorname{I}}^{\*}\{1\}\rightarrow | \displaystyle\underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{\*}\xrightarrow{F}\underline{% \operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{\*}\rightarrow 0 |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.3.10.b) |  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow 2\underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{\*}\xrightarrow{H} | \displaystyle\underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{\*}\xrightarrow{P}\underline{% \operatorname{I}}^{\*}\rightarrow 0 |  |

where F (resp. P) is canonical projection to the cokernel of the endomorphism of \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{\*}
obtained by multiplication with \eta (resp. h).

###### Proof.

3.4.5 implies that both sequences are left exact and we are left to prove surjectivity
of the maps denoted by F and P. This follows from the long exact sequences of 3.4.6
and Theorem 4.3.5.
∎

By being more precise, one can (partially) extend the previous result.
