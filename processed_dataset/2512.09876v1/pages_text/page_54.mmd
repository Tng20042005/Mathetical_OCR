|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(\widetilde{X})\;=\;\operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{% 1}(S)\oplus\operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(S)\;=\;0. |  |

Thus the hypothesis \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(\widetilde{X})=0 of Lemma 4.4.9 is
satisfied, and that lemma yields an exact sequence

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \kappa(\mathfrak{p})^{\times}\oplus\kappa(\mathfrak{p})^{\times}\xrightarrow{% \ N\_{y\_{1}/x}+N\_{y\_{2}/x}\ }\kappa(\mathfrak{p})^{\times}\longrightarrow% \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X)\longrightarrow 0, |  |

and each norm map N\_{y\_{i}/x} is the identity on \kappa(\mathfrak{p})^{\times}.
Hence the first arrow is the multiplication map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \kappa(\mathfrak{p})^{\times}\times\kappa(\mathfrak{p})^{\times}% \longrightarrow\kappa(\mathfrak{p})^{\times},\quad(a,b)\mapsto ab, |  |

which is surjective. It follows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X)=0, |  |

so \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X) is in particular 2-divisible. Together with the verification
of (1) above, both hypotheses of Theorem 4.4.6 are satisfied by
this X, and the forgetful map (4.4.4.b) is an isomorphism.

This completes the proof in both cases.

###### 4.4.13.

In fact, in the case of an excellent scheme X of dimension 1,
we can extend the previous techniques to get a complete computation of all the \mathbf{Z}-graded Chow-Witt
groups with coefficients in the main MW-modules of 3.4.4.
In practice, the localization long exact sequence allows us
to reduce to the case where X=\operatorname{Spec}(R)
is the spectrum of a Dedekind domain of finite type over \mathbf{Z},
which we will adopt for the following next results. We start with the case M=\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}.

###### Proposition 4.4.14.

Let X=\operatorname{Spec}(R) be the spectrum of a Dedekind domain of finite type222222More generally, this should work if X is the spectrum of a Dedekind domain with finite residue fields when q\leq 2. over \mathbf{Z},
with function field K, and let r be the number of real places of K (so r=0 if \mathrm{char}(K)>0).
Then one has:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A\_{0}(X,\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{q})=\begin{cases}\operatorname{Cl}(R)&q=0,\\ 0&\text{otherwise,}\end{cases} | A\_{1}(X,\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{q-1})=\begin{cases}\mathbf{Z}&q=0,\\ R^{\times}&q=1,\\ \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{2}(R)&q=2,\\ (\mathbf{Z}/2)^{r}&q>2.\end{cases} |

###### Proof.

The computation stated in the first column
follows by the very definition for q=0,
4.4.3 for q=1, and the vanishing of \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{q}(k) for k a finite field and q>1.
For the second column, the cases q=0,1 are obvious,
q=2 is by definition while the case q>2 follows from [BT73, II, §2, Th. (2.1)].
∎

###### Remark 4.4.15.

Note that the abelian group \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{2}(R) appearing in the previous theorem was explicitly computed by Tate in most of the cases.
We refer the reader to [BT73, Appendix].

###### 4.4.16.

Let us continue with the case of Witt K-theory. We first introduce a new abelian group used in the next proposition. Given an arbitrary 1-dimensional scheme X of finite type over \mathbf{Z}, we consider the map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial:\bigoplus\_{\mathfrak{p},2\nmid\mathfrak{p}}\mathbf{Z}/2\rightarrow{% \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{2}}(X)/2,(\epsilon\_{\mathfrak{p}})\_{% \mathfrak{p}}\mapsto\sum\_{\mathfrak{p},\epsilon\_{\mathfrak{p}}\neq 0}\{-\pi\_{% \mathfrak{p}},\pi\_{\mathfrak{p}}\}\text{ mod }2 |  |

and denote by \underline{\operatorname{k}}^{M}\_{2}(X) its cokernel.

###### Proposition 4.4.17.
