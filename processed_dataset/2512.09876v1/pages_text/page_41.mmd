by K\_{S}\{\mathcal{L}\}.

When S is regular, a natural choice for the homological conventions is K\_{S}=\mathcal{O}\_{S}[\dim(S)].
Then the corresponding dimension function \delta is the *Krull dimension*,
and the pinning \lambda over an S-point x:\operatorname{Spec}(E)\rightarrow S is defined by:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.5.a) |  | \lambda\_{x}=\omega\_{x/s}\otimes\nu\_{s}^{\vee}=\omega\_{x} |  |

where s\in S is the image of x, \omega\_{x/s}=\det(\mathbb{L}\_{x/s}) is the determinant
of the cotangent complex of the (finitely generated) field extension E/\kappa(s)
and \nu\_{s}=\det(\mathcal{N}\_{s/S\_{(s)}}) is the determinant of the conormal sheaf of s in the local scheme S\_{(s)}.
With these particular choices, one gets:

* •

  the Chow-Witt group \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{p}(X/S,\mathcal{L}) is a sub-quotient
  of \oplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}\operatorname{GW}(\kappa(x),\omega\_{x/S}\otimes\mathcal{L%
  }\_{x}).
  It is made of rational equivalence classes of quadratic cycles (4.1.2) whose support is of pure Krull
  dimension p.
* •

  The Chow-group \operatorname{CH}\_{0}(X/S) corresponds to classes of algebraic cycles made of closed points of X.
* •

  When S is the spectrum of a perfect field k, a MW-module M is a Milnor-Witt module in the sense
  of [Fel20] and the Chow-Witt group A\_{p}(X/k,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) defined here agrees with
  that of *loc. cit.* Definition 5.4 taken into account the convention of §4.1.

###### Example 4.1.6.

Quadratic degree.
Note that pushforwards exist at the level of cycles,
while only smooth pullbacks exist at the level of cycles.
In [FJ25], flat pullbacks are defined and do exist at the cycle level.

In particular, we get a quadratic degree map associated with any proper
S-scheme X:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{\widetilde{deg}}\_{X/S}:\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(0)}}\operatorname{GW}% (\kappa(x),\omega\_{x/s}\otimes\nu\_{s}^{\vee})=\widetilde{\operatorname{Z}}{}\_{% 0}(X/S)\rightarrow\widetilde{\operatorname{Z}}{}\_{0}(S)=\bigoplus\_{s\in S\_{(0)% }}\operatorname{GW}(\kappa(s),\nu\_{s}^{\vee}). |  |

In fact, this quadratic degree map is obtained by taking the sum over point x\in X
of the Scharlau transfer map associated with the differential trace map
\mathit{tr}^{\omega}\_{x/s}:\omega\_{x/s}\rightarrow\kappa(s) defined out a Grothendieck duality
(see [Dég25, Def. 6.2.4]):

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathit{tr}\_{x/s}:\operatorname{GW}(\kappa(x),\omega\_{x/s}\otimes\nu\_{s}^{\vee% })\rightarrow\operatorname{GW}(\kappa(s),\nu\_{s}^{\vee}),\omega\mapsto\mathit{% tr}^{\omega}\_{x/s\*}(\omega) |  |

Explicitly, \mathit{tr}^{\omega}\_{x/s\*}(\omega) is (the class of) the composite map:
E\times E\xrightarrow{\omega}\omega\_{x/s}\otimes\nu\_{s}^{\vee}\xrightarrow{\ %
\mathit{tr}^{\omega}\_{x/s}\otimes\operatorname{Id}\ }\nu\_{s}^{\vee}.

Note that similarly to the classical intersection theory ([Ful98, Example 1.4.2]),
the quadratic degre trace map is defined even without assuming that X is proper over S, but in the non proper case it does not preserve rational equivalence.

### 4.2. Cohomological Chow-Witt groups

###### 4.2.1.

We consider the notation of 4.1.1.
In particular, S is a base scheme equipped
with both a dimension function \delta and a pinning \lambda,
and M is one of the MW-module of (4.1.1.a).

Still following 3.3.7, we now introduce our cohomological conventions.
For an S-scheme X which is now assumed to be essentially slci,
with canonical sheaf \omega\_{X}, one puts:
