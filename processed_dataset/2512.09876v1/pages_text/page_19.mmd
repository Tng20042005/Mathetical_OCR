where E\_{p,q}^{1,\pi} is (abusively) defined as previously, but twisted accordingly.
By Theorem 2.1.3, the page E\_{p,q}^{1,\pi} is isomorphic to \bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}A\_{q}(V\_{x},\mathcal{M},\*). According to the property 1.2.7, this last expression is isomorphic (via the map \pi) to \bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}A\_{q}(\operatorname{Spec}\kappa(x),\mathcal{M},\*). Using again 2.1.3, this group is isomorphic to E\_{p,q}^{1,\operatorname{Id}\_{X}}, which converge to A\_{p+q}(X,\mathcal{M},\*). By Proposition 1.5.4, the map \pi induces a morphism of exact couples

(D\_{p,q}^{1,\operatorname{Id}\_{X}},E\_{p,q}^{1,\operatorname{Id}\_{X}})\to(D\_{p,%
q+n}^{1,\pi},E\_{p,q+n}^{1,\pi})

hence we have compatible isomorphisms on the pages which induce the pullback

{\pi^{!}:A\_{q}(X,\mathcal{M},\*)\to A\_{q+n}(V,\mathcal{M},\*)}.

### 2.2. Gysin morphisms for slci maps

###### 2.2.1.

The classical approach of Fulton-Verdier ([Ful98, §6]) defines Gysin morphisms at the level of Chow groups associated with slci morphisms, which is a cornerstone of the intersection theory in Chow groups; such a construction has been extended to Chow groups with coefficients in cycle modules ([Ros96, §11]), and more recently to twisted Borel-Moore theories that are representable in the motivic stable homotopy category ([DJK21]). 888In a forthcoming work,
we will extend Gysin morphisms to the level of cycles via \infty-categorical techniques.
We use the same strategy here to define Gysin morphisms for Chow-Witt groups with coefficients in MW-homodules, while carefully taking into account the twists as in [Fel20, §10].

###### 2.2.2.

For the remainder on the section, we fix \mathcal{M} a MW-homodule.
Let i:Z\to X be a closed immersion of (possibly singular) S-schemes. Let t be a parameter of \mathbf{A}^{1} and let

{q:X\times\_{S}(\mathbf{A}^{1}\setminus\{0\})\to X}

be the canonical projection. Denote by D=D\_{Z}X the deformation space such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | {D=U\sqcup N\_{Z}X} |  |

where U=X\times\_{S}(\mathbf{A}^{1}\setminus\{0\}) (see [Ros96, §10] for more details).

Consider the morphism

J(X,Z)=J\_{Z/X}:A^{\*}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\to A^{\*}(N\_{Z}X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)

defined by the composition:

\xymatrix@=14pt{A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[r]^{-}{q^{!}}\ar@{-->}[d]\_{J\_{Z/%
X}}&A\_{p+1}(U,\mathcal{M}\_{q-1},\*)\ar[d]^{[t]}\\
A\_{p}(N\_{Z}X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)A\_{p+1}(U,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\ar[l]^{-}\partial}

where \partial is the boundary map of 1.4.6, associated with the closed immersion N\_{Z}X\rightarrow D\_{Z}X.
This defines a morphism (also denoted by J(X,Z) or J\_{Z/X}) by passing to homology.

Assume moreover that i:Z\to X is regular of codimension n, the map \pi:N\_{Z}X\to Z is a vector bundle over X of dimension n. By homotopy invariance (Theorem 2.1.4), we have an isomorphism

\pi^{!}:A\_{p-n}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\omega\_{i}\otimes\*)\to A\_{p}(N\_{Z}X,\mathcal%
{M}\_{q},\*)
