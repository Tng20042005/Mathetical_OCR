\mathcal{L}).
Remark that, according to the previous periodicity result, one gets:
\operatorname{W}^{[-p]}\_{-p-q}=\operatorname{W}\_{-q}=\operatorname{W}^{[q]}. In particular, the above spectral
sequence can be identified, in caracteristic not 2,
with that of [BW02, Th. 7.2]

When X has dimension 1, the spectral sequence degenerate at E\_{2}.
Moreover, according to [CDH{}^{+}20, Cor. 1.3.8],
one deduces that \operatorname{W}^{[-p]}\_{-p-q}(\kappa(x),\omega\_{x}\otimes\mathcal{L}\_{x}) vanishes
for q odd.
In particular, when X has dimension 1,
the only contribution to \operatorname{W}^{[0]}\_{0}(X,\mathcal{L}) is given by the E\_{2}-term E\_{2}^{0,0},
which is precisely \underline{\operatorname{W}}\_{0}^{[0]}(X,\mathcal{L}).
∎

We end-up with a complete computation of all Chow-Witt groups with coefficients in \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*} in the 1-dimensional case.

###### Theorem 4.4.20.

Let X=\operatorname{Spec}(R) be the spectrum of a Dedekind domain of finite type over \mathbf{Z}, with function field K, and let r be the number of real places of K. Let \mathcal{L} be a line bundle over \operatorname{Spec}(R), corresponding to a projective R-module L of rank 1. Then one gets:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A\_{0}(X,\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{q},\mathcal{L})=\begin{cases}0&q>0,\\ \operatorname{Cl}(R)&q=0,\\ \operatorname{Cl}(R)/2&q<0,\end{cases} | A\_{1}(X,\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{q},\mathcal{L})=\begin{cases}\underline{% \operatorname{W}}(R,L)&q<0,\\ \underline{\operatorname{GW}}(R,L)&q=0,\\ \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{1}(R,L)&q=1,\\ \mathbf{Z}^{r}&q>1.\\ \end{cases} |

Moreover, one has exact sequences:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.4.20.a) |  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow\underline{\operatorname{I}}(R,L)\rightarrow% \underline{\operatorname{GW}}(R,L)\rightarrow\mathbf{Z}\rightarrow 0 |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.4.20.b) |  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow\underline{\operatorname{I}}^{2}(R,L)\rightarrow% \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{1}(R,L)\rightarrow R^{\times}\rightarrow 0 |  |

###### Proof.

All assertions follow from the computations of the two previous propositions
and the exact sequence (3.4.6.b).
Note in particular that, for q>1, the existence of the exact sequence:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 0\rightarrow\mathbf{Z}^{r}\rightarrow A\_{1}(X,\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{q},% \mathcal{L})\rightarrow(\mathbf{Z}/2)^{r}\rightarrow 0 |  |

forces the middle group to be \mathbf{Z}^{r}, as for each real place of K,
the image of the corresponding factor on the left column is necessarily 2-divisible.

### 4.5. Finiteness results

###### 4.5.1.

Recall the following conjecture (see [Wei13, IV, 6.8] and [Kah05, Conj. 36]):

###### Conjecture 4.5.2 (Bass).

For any scheme X of finite type over \operatorname{Spec}\mathbf{Z}, and any integer n\geq 0, the K^{\prime}-theory (also called G-theory) group K^{\prime}\_{n}(X) is finitely generated.

This conjecture is known if X is of dimension at most 1 (see [Kah05, Prop. 38]).

Inspired by the Bass Conjecture 4.5.2, we introduce the following finiteness conditions on MW-homodules.

###### Definition 4.5.3.

Let S be a base scheme essentially of finite type over \mathbf{Z}, and let R be a ring.

1. (1)

   Let \mathcal{M} be an R-linear MW-homodule over S.
   Given an S-scheme X essentially of finite type, we say that \mathcal{M} is *R-homologically finite relative to X* or satisfies the property \big{(}\text{FT}^{R}\_{X}\big{)},
   if for all pair of integers p,q, and every line bundle \mathcal{L} over X, A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L}) is a finitely generated R-module.

   We say that \mathcal{M} is *R-homologically finite* or satisfies the property \big{(}\text{FT}^{R}\big{)}
   if \mathcal{M} satisfies \big{(}\text{FT}^{R}\_{X}\big{)} for any S-scheme X of finite type.
