Combining Examples 1.1.7, 1.3.6, one deduces that Quillen algebraic K’-theory
defines an M-homodule \mathcal{K}\_{\*} over S.
The associated dual M-module \operatorname{K}\_{\*}, obtained from the above theorem,
readily corresponds to the Quillen algebraic K-theory restricted to S-fields.

Note that the canonical *symbol map* induces a morphism of M-modules:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5.10.a) |  | \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}\rightarrow\operatorname{K}\_{\*} |  |

which is an isomorphism in degree at most 2, according to Matsumoto’s theorem.

###### 3.5.11.

Consider the above notation and fix a M-module M.
As in the case if MW-modules 3.5.11,
one defines the homological (resp. cohomological) complex of cycles of X with coefficients in M as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5.11.a) |  | \displaystyle C\_{p}(X,M\_{q}) | \displaystyle=C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{D}(M)\_{q})=\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}M\_{q+p}(x) |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5.11.b) |  | \displaystyle C^{p}(X,M\_{q}) | \displaystyle=C^{p}(X,\mathcal{D}(M)\_{q})=\bigoplus\_{x\in X^{(p)}}M\_{q-p}(x). |  |

see respectively (1.3.3.a) and (1.3.7.a).
Note that there also exists a definition twisted by a line bundle \mathcal{L},
but according to (3.5.1.a), this definition does not depend on the chosen twists and agrees with the above one.
Note also that it follows from our definition that, under the equivalence of 3.5.7,
the above definition agrees with the one given in [Ros96, §5].

Taking homology (resp. cohomology),
one deduces a twisted Borel-Moore homology theory A\_{\*}(X,M) and respectively a cohomology theory
A^{\*}(X,M) satisfying the expected axioms over S, as proved in the previous sections.
Beware that the twists now only comes from the grading of M, as the twist by line bundles
are no longer relevant.
Therefore, the axioms satisfied by the above pair of homology and cohomology theories
are precisely that of [BO74] — except the base S can be arbitrary according to the conventions of this paper,
rather than just a field.
Finally, using 2.4, one also define a cohomology with support,
and Thom isomorphisms in the untwisted form,
which shows that the associated cohomology theory is canonically (\operatorname{GL}-)oriented.
This justifies the terminology orientable MW-module.

Finally, we note that 3.4.3 gives the following comparison result between
our general notion of MW-homodule and the extension of Rost’s definition of cycle modules over a base (with a dimension function).

###### Corollary 3.5.12.

Let S be a base scheme (admitting a dimension function \delta).
Then the category of Rost cycle modules over S is a full abelian sub-category of that of MW-modules \operatorname{MW-Homod}\_{S},
and the inclusion functor admits a right adjoint. Using the notation from above:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \xymatrix@=30pt{\operatorname{M-Mod}\_{S}=\operatorname{MW-Mod}\_{S}^{\eta=0}\ar% @<3pt>^{-}{\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}}[r]\ar@{}|-\sim[r]&\operatorname{MW-% Homod}\_{S}^{\eta=0}\ar@<2pt>^{-}\operatorname{D}[l]\ar@<3pt>^{-}{j\_{\eta}}[r]% \operatorname{MW-Homod}\_{S}\ar@<2pt>^{-}{Q\_{\eta}}[l]} |  |
