We will use the homological conventions of 4.1.1, with X=S.
In particular, according to 4.1.2
(resp. 4.3.3) for any line bundle \mathcal{L} on X,
one defines the Chow-Witt group \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{0}(X,\mathcal{L})
of (Milnor-Witt) 0-cycles
(resp. unramified first Milnor-Witt first K-group \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{1}(X,\mathcal{L}))
as the cokernel (resp. kernel) of the
(quadratic) divisor class map:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.4.4.a) |  | \bigoplus\_{\eta\in X\_{(1)}}\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{1}(\kappa(\eta),\mathcal{L}\_% {\eta})\xrightarrow{\mathrm{div}\_{X}}\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(0)}}\operatorname{GW}% (\kappa(x),\lambda\_{x}\otimes\mathcal{L}\_{x}) |  |

Replacing Milnor-Witt K-theory by Milnor K-theory, or in fact Quillen K-theory,
one similarly gets the Chow group \operatorname{CH}\_{0}(X) of 0-cycles on X
(resp. unramified (Milnor) K-theory \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{1}(X)).
Then (4.1.2.a) provides a canonical “forgetful map”

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.4.4.b) |  | F:\widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{0}(X,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\operatorname{% CH}\_{0}(X). |  |

###### Example 4.4.5.

In general, the map (4.4.4.b) is not always an isomorphism. Here are a few examples:

1. (1)

   If X is the spectrum of a field F, then the map (4.4.4.b) is canonically identified with the rank map \operatorname{GW}(F,\mathcal{L})\to\mathbf{Z}, which is not always an isomorphism.
2. (2)

   If F is a field and \mathcal{L} is an odd degree line bundle over the projective line \mathbf{P}^{1}\_{F}, Fasel ([Fas13]) shows
   that \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}^{1}(\mathbf{P}^{1}\_{F},\mathcal{L})\simeq%
   \operatorname{GW}(F) (see also [Dég25, Th. 3.4.4] for an elementary proof), and the rank map \operatorname{GW}(F)\rightarrow\mathbf{Z} need not be an isomorphism as above.
3. (3)

   Here is an example of a smooth affine curve. We know that the map (4.4.4.b) together with the map P in (4.3.10.b) induce a canonical map

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (4.4.5.a) |  | \widetilde{\operatorname{CH}}{}\_{0}(X,\mathcal{L})\to\operatorname{CH}\_{0}(X)% \oplus H\_{0}^{BM}(X\_{r},\mathcal{L}) |  |

   where H\_{0}^{BM}(X\_{r},\mathcal{L}) is the Borel-Moore real étale homology ([JX25]), and the map (4.4.5.a) is an isomorphism after inverting 2. If X=\operatorname{Spec}R where R=\mathbf{R}[X,Y]/(X^{2}+Y^{2}-1) is a Dedekind domain, then the topological space X(\mathbf{R}) is simply the sphere S^{1}, and we have

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | H\_{0}^{BM}(X\_{r},\mathcal{O}\_{X})\simeq H\_{0}^{BM}(X(\mathbf{R}))\simeq H\_{0}^% {BM}(S^{1})\simeq\mathbf{Z}, |  |

   so the map (4.4.4.b) is not an isomorphism.

The goal of this section is to give a criterion for the map (4.4.4.b) to be an isomorphism.
The following result is a consequence of all the theory we have developed,
together with the Milnor conjecture as restated in 3.4.5.

###### Theorem 4.4.6.

Consider the above notation and assume that the following conditions hold:

1. (1)

   The residue field \kappa(x) of every closed point x\in X\_{(0)} satisfies I^{2}(\kappa(x))=0.
2. (2)

   The group \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X), namely the kernel of the map (4.4.1.a), is 2-divisible.

Then the map (4.4.4.b) is an isomorphism.

###### Proof.

Under our assumptions and notation, the exact sequence (3.4.6.b)
gives rise to the following short exact sequence:
