Indeed, it is known that \operatorname{K}^{MW} satisfy the property (R5) (Def. 2.13) of that paper (Th. 1.4),
and one deduces that M does satisfy (R5) as for any field E, M(E,\mathcal{L}) is obtained
by tensoring with \operatorname{K}^{MW}(E)[e^{-1}] or \operatorname{K}^{MW}(E)/(e) respectively.

###### 4.3.6.

Bloch’s formula is no longer true if X is singular.
For example, let X be the spectrum of a 1-dimensional noetherian domain A.
Then by definition, the group \operatorname{CH}^{1}(X)=\mathrm{Cl}(A) is trivial if and only if A is principal.

In particular, if A is in addition local,
\operatorname{CH}^{1}(A)=0 if and only if A is regular (*i.e.* a discrete valuation ring).
So under these assumptions on A, Bloch’s formula for \operatorname{CH}^{1} and the Zariski topology is true
if and only if A is regular.
In particular, any strict order A in a number ring localized at a prime \mathfrak{p}
dividing its conductor is a counter-example to Bloch’s formula for the Zariski topology.
To get a counter-example for the Nisnevich topology,
one can take the henselization A\_{\mathfrak{p}}^{h}.
As a conclusion, one may highlight the following result which
shows that the assumptions of the above theorem are somewhat optimal.

###### Scholium 4.3.7.

Let S be an integral 1-dimensional base scheme,
and t={\mathrm{Zar}},{\mathrm{Nis}}. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

1. (1)

   S is regular.
2. (2)

   For every essentially smooth S-scheme X, we have
   \operatorname{CH}^{1}(X)\simeq H^{1}\_{\mathrm{Zar}}\big{(}X,\underline{%
   \operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{1}\big{)}.
3. (3)

   For every localization X of S, we have
   \operatorname{CH}^{1}(X)\simeq H^{1}\_{\mathrm{Zar}}\big{(}X,\underline{%
   \operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{1}\big{)}.
4. (4)

   For every essentially smooth S-scheme X, we have
   \operatorname{CH}^{1}(X)\simeq H^{1}\_{\mathrm{Nis}}\big{(}X,\underline{%
   \operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{1}\big{)}.
5. (5)

   For every {\mathrm{Nis}}-localization X of S, we have
   \operatorname{CH}^{1}(X)\simeq H^{1}\_{\mathrm{Nis}}\big{(}X,\underline{%
   \operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{1}\big{)}.

We will see that the same results hold for the Milnor-Witt extension of Bloch’s formula
(4.3.5.b).
Let us now draw some corollaries of Theorem 4.3.5.
