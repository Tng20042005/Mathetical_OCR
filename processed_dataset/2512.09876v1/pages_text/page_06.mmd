S, the expression “base scheme”
will mean an excellent noetherian and finite dimensional scheme equipped with a fixed dimension function \delta
(sometimes made explicit in the text).
Then an S-scheme will always be assumed essentially of finite type over S,
and equipped with the dimension function induced by \delta.
Our conventions on points, traits and valuations are spelled out in 0.0.2.

###### 0.0.2.

Points and traits.
Let S be a base scheme.
A *point* x of S is a map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | x:\operatorname{Spec}(E)\longrightarrow S |  |

essentially of finite type with E a field; we also say that E is an *S-field*.
A *trait* t of S is a map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | t:\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O})\longrightarrow S |  |

essentially of finite type with \mathcal{O} a discrete valuation ring; we also say that \mathcal{O} is an *S-DVR*.
A *singular trait* of S is a map \operatorname{Spec}(A)\to S essentially of finite type with A a local ring of dimension 1.
We write x\in X to denote a point of the underlying topological space of a scheme X.
Given an S-field E, an *S-valuation* on E is a valuation v on E whose valuation ring \mathcal{O}\_{v} defines a trait

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}\_{v})\rightarrow S. |  |

We denote by \kappa(v) the residue field, by \mathfrak{m}\_{v} the valuation ideal and by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \nu\_{v}=\mathfrak{m}\_{v}/\mathfrak{m}\_{v}^{2} |  |

its cotangent space at the closed point.
We let \mathscr{F}\_{S} (resp. \mathcal{G}\_{S}) be the full subcategory of the category of S-schemes essentially of finite type whose objects consist of S-fields (resp. S-fields *and* S-DVRs).

###### 0.0.3.

Dimension functions.
A *dimensional scheme* is a pair (S,\delta) with \delta a dimension function.
We will use the notation of [BD17, 1.1] (see there for a reminder on dimension functions).
In particular, one denotes by \delta(S)=\delta\_{+}(S) (resp. \delta\_{-}(S)) the maximum (resp. minimum) of the function \delta.
In a situation where a base scheme (S,\delta) is given and X/S is a scheme essentially of finite type,
we will always assume, unless explicitly stated otherwise, that the dimension function on X is induced by that of S
(see [BD17, 1.1.7]).
Moreover, we simply put X\_{(p)}=\{x\in X\mid\delta(x)=p\}.
If, in addition, X/S is essentially of finite type, one defines the *\delta-codimension function of X/S* as
\operatorname{co}\delta\_{X}=d\_{X/S}-\delta\_{X}, where d\_{X/S}=\dim(f) is the relative dimension function ([BD17, 1.1.9]).
Then we put: X^{(p)}=\{x\in X\mid\operatorname{co}\delta\_{X}(x)=p\}.

###### 0.0.4.

Linear algebra conventions.
We will fix a coefficient ring R, commutative with unit.
We use the notation of [Mor12, Chap. 3] for the *Milnor-Witt K-theory ring* \mathcal{K}^{MW}\_{\*}(E)
of a field E and its elements (see also [Fel20, Dég25]).
We also denote by \operatorname{GW}(E), \operatorname{W}(E) the Grothendieck-Witt ring and Witt ring of the field E,
built out of symmetric bilinear forms rather than quadratic forms.

Further conventions:

* •

  M MW-modules (cohomological Milnor-Witt cycle modules)
* •

  \mathcal{M} MW-homodules (homological Milnor-Witt cycle modules)
* •

  \mathcal{L} or simply \* line bundle
* •

  v,w virtual vector bundles
* •

  f,g scheme morphisms; \phi,\psi ring morphisms
* •

  \lambda,\lambda^{\prime} pinning (3.1.3)
