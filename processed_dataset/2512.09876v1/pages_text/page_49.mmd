### 4.4. The graded Chow-Witt groups of a 1-dimensional scheme

###### 4.4.1.

We first generalize the definition of the abelian group \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(A) of a regular ring A
to the case of possibly singular schemes X. We assume that X is a scheme such that
\delta=-\operatorname{codim}\_{X} is a dimension function. According to 4.3.4, this
allows us to define the unramified K-theory (resp. Milnor K-theory) sheaf
\operatorname{\underline{K}}\_{\*} (resp. \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{\*}), associated with the M-homodule \mathcal{K}\_{\*} (resp. the
M-module \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}); see 1.3.6. According to Matsumoto’s
theorem, these two \mathbf{Z}-graded sheaves coincide in degrees <3.
Next, we consider the coniveau spectral sequence of X associated with K^{\prime}-theory,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E\_{1}^{p,q}=\bigoplus\_{x\in X^{(p)}}K\_{-p-q}(\kappa(x))\;\Longrightarrow\;K^{% \prime}\_{-p-q}(X). |  |

Since K\_{i}(\kappa(x))=0 for i<0, this spectral sequence is concentrated in the
region p\geq 0, p+q\leq 0. Its E\_{2}-page can be identified with

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E\_{2}^{p,q}\simeq H^{p}(X,\operatorname{\underline{K}}\_{-q}). |  |

In particular,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E\_{2}^{0,-1}=H^{0}(X,\operatorname{\underline{K}}\_{1})=\operatorname{% \underline{K}}\_{1}(X)=\underline{\operatorname{K}}^{M}\_{1}(X). |  |

The coniveau spectral sequence yields a decreasing filtration
F^{\bullet}K^{\prime}\_{1}(X) whose associated graded pieces are the groups
E\_{\infty}^{p,q} with p+q=-1. The corresponding edge morphism of the spectral
sequence is a natural homomorphism

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.4.1.a) |  | \phi:K^{\prime}\_{1}(X)\longrightarrow E\_{2}^{0,-1}=\operatorname{\underline{K}% }\_{1}(X). |  |

If moreover X has dimension \leq 1, then E\_{r}^{p,q}=0 for p\geq 2, so for
r\geq 2 there is no non-trivial differential with source or target E\_{r}^{0,-1}.
Hence E\_{2}^{0,-1}=E\_{\infty}^{0,-1} in this case. The group E\_{\infty}^{0,-1} is
the first graded piece of the coniveau filtration on K^{\prime}\_{1}(X), and it follows that
the edge morphism (4.4.1.a) is an epimorphism.

###### Definition 4.4.2.

Consider the preceding assumptions,
one defines the group \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X) as the kernel of the map (4.4.1.a).

###### Remark 4.4.3.

1. (1)

   If X is normal and excellent, then \operatorname{\underline{K}}\_{1}(X)\simeq\mathbf{G}\_{m}(X), and by
   Proposition 4.3.11 the map (4.4.1.a) is the usual determinant
   map K^{\prime}\_{1}(X)\to\mathbf{G}\_{m}(X). In particular, when X is regular (so that
   K^{\prime}\_{1}(X)\simeq K\_{1}(X)), the group \operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X) identifies with the classical
   group \operatorname{SK}\_{1}(X).
2. (2)

   Let X be a (possibly singular) scheme of dimension 1.
   One deduces from the localization exact sequence in K^{\prime}-theory the isomorphism:

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (4.4.3.a) |  | A\_{0}(X,\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{1})\simeq\operatorname{SK}^{\prime}\_{1}(X). |  |

###### 4.4.4.

Let us fix a 1-dimensional base scheme X with a pinning \lambda, and \delta=\dim.
