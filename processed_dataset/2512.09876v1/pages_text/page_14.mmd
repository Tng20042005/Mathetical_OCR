as follows. Let x be in X\_{(p)} and \rho\in\mathcal{M}(\kappa(x),\*). We consider [a\_{1}(x),\dots,a\_{n}(x)] as an element of {\operatorname{K}^{MW}(\kappa(x),\*)}.
If x=y, then put [a\_{1},\dots,a\_{n}]^{x}\_{y}(\rho)=[a\_{1}(x),\dots,a\_{n}(x)]\cdot\rho). Otherwise, put [a\_{1},\dots,a\_{n}]^{x}\_{y}(\rho)=0.

###### 1.4.5.

Multiplication with \eta
Define

\eta:C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\to C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q-1},\*)

as follows. If x=y,
then \eta^{x}\_{y}(\rho)=\gamma\_{\eta}(\rho).
Otherwise, \eta^{x}\_{y}(\rho)=0.

###### 1.4.6.

Boundary maps
Let X be a scheme, let i:Z\to X be a closed immersion and let j:U=X\setminus Z\to X be the inclusion of the open complement. We will refer to (Z,i,X,j,U) as a boundary triple and define

\partial=\partial^{U}\_{Z}:C\_{p}(U,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)\to C\_{p-1}(Z,\mathcal{M}\_%
{q},\*)

by taking \partial^{x}\_{y} to be as the definition in 1.2.1 with respect to X. The map \partial^{U}\_{Z} is called the boundary map associated to the boundary triple, or just the boundary map for the closed immersion i:Z\to X.

###### 1.4.7.

Generalized correspondences
We will use the notation

\alpha:[X,\*]\bullet\!\!\!\to[Y,\*]

or simply

\alpha:X\bullet\!\!\!\to Y

to denote maps of complexes which are sums of composites of the five basics maps f\_{\*}, g^{!}, [a], \eta, \partial for schemes over k.
Unlike Rost in [Ros96, §3], we look at these morphisms up to quasi-isomorphisms so that a morphism \alpha:X\bullet\!\!\!\to Y may be a weak inverse of a well-defined morphism of complexes.

### 1.5. Compatibilities

In this section we establish the basic compatibilities for the maps considered in the last section. Fix \mathcal{M} a MW-homodule.

###### Proposition 1.5.1.

1. (1)

   Let f:X\to Y and f^{\prime}:Y\to Z be two morphisms of schemes. Then

   (f^{\prime}\circ f)\_{\*}=f^{\prime}\_{\*}\circ f\_{\*}.
2. (2)

   Let g:Y\to X and g^{\prime}:Z\to Y be two essentially smooth morphisms. Then:

   (g\circ g^{\prime})^{!}=g^{\prime!}\circ g^{!}.
3. (3)

   Consider a pullback diagram of schemes

   \xymatrix{U\ar[r]^{g^{\prime}}\ar[d]\_{f^{\prime}}&Z\ar[d]^{f}\\
   Y\ar[r]\_{g}X}

   with g and g^{\prime} essentially smooth. Then

   g^{!}\circ f\_{\*}=f^{\prime}\_{\*}\circ g^{\prime!}.

###### Proof.

1. (1)

   This is clear from the definition and by 1.1.1.
2. (2)

   The claim is trivial by 1.1.1 (again, there are no multiplicities).
3. (3)

   This reduces to the rule 1.1.1 (see [Ros96, Proposition 4.1]).

∎

###### Proposition 1.5.2.

Let f:Y\to X be a morphism of schemes. If a is a unit on X, then

f\_{\*}\circ[\tilde{f}^{!}(a)]=[a]\circ f\_{\*}

where \tilde{f}^{!}:\mathcal{O}^{\*}\_{X}\to\mathcal{O}^{\*}\_{Y} is induced by f.

###### Proof.

This comes from 1.1.1.
∎

###### Proposition 1.5.3.

Let a be a unit on a scheme X.

1. (1)

   Let g:Y\to X be an essentially smooth morphism. One has

   g^{!}\circ[a]=[\tilde{g}^{!}(a)]\circ g^{!}.
2. (2)

   Let (Z,i,X,j,U) be a boundary triple. One has
