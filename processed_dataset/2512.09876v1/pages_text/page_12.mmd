d=d\_{X}:C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M},\*)\to C\_{p-1}(X,\mathcal{M},\*)

where d^{x}\_{y}=\partial^{x}\_{y} as in 1.2.1. This definition makes sense by axiom 1.2.2.

More precisely, for any integer q and any line bundle \mathcal{L}, we define:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.3.3.a) |  | C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L})=\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}\mathcal{M}\_{q+p}% (\kappa(x),\mathcal{L}\_{x}). |  |

and

d=d\_{X}:C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L})\to C\_{p-1}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},%
\mathcal{L})

where d^{x}\_{y}=\partial^{x}\_{y} as in 1.2.1. This definition makes sense by axiom 1.2.2.

We have

C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M},\*)=\bigoplus\_{q\in\mathbf{Z}}C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*).

###### Proposition 1.3.4.

With the previous notations, we have d\circ d=0.

###### Proof.

Same as in [Ros96, §3.3]. Axiom 1.2.2 is needed.

###### Definition 1.3.5.

The complex
(C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M},\*),d)\_{p\in\mathbf{Z}} (resp.
(C\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*),d)\_{p\in\mathbf{Z}}) of graded abelian groups (resp. abelian groups) is called the *cycle complex on X with coefficients in \mathcal{M} (resp. \mathcal{M}\_{q})*.

We define the p-th *Chow-Witt group with coefficients in \mathcal{M}* as the p-th homology group of the complex C\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M},\*) (resp. C\_{\*}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)).
We denote it by A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M},\*) (resp. A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\*)).

As a dimension function is Zariski locally constant, this complex only depends on \delta up to a shift over each
connected components of S. If we want to be precise, we use the notation C^{\delta}\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M},\*), A\_{p}^{\delta}(X,\mathcal{M},\*). Note that these groups of homological type (see below for the functoriality)
are in fact trigraded. In the notation A\_{p}(X,\mathcal{M}\_{q},\mathcal{L}), the integer p is the simplicial degree,
q is the \mathbf{G}\_{m}-degree,555This can also be called the weight, but this terminology can cause confusion.
In motivic homotopy, the \mathbf{G}\_{m}-degree corresponds to the twist \mathbbm{1}(1)[1] and the weight is usually considered
to be the twits \mathbbm{1}(1). and the line bundle \mathcal{L} is a Thom-twist.666In motivic terms,
it is more precisely a twist by the Thom space of the virtual vector bundle \mathcal{L}-\mathcal{O}\_{X} of virtual
rank 0.
