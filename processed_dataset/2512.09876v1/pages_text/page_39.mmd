We will now illustrate the theory obtained by specializing to Milnor-Witt K-theory \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*},
seen as a MW-module according to 3.3.6.
As in *loc. cit.*, we fix a base scheme S,
endowed with a dimension function \delta and a pinning \lambda (Definition 3.1.3).151515For convenient explicit choices,
see 4.1.5.

To set up the notation, let us consider the MW-modules over S introduced in 3.4.4, or 3.4.5:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.1.a) |  | M\in\{\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*},\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}=\operatorname{K}^{MW}% \_{\*}/\eta,2\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*},\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}/2,\operatorname{W% }=\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*}[\eta^{-1}],\operatorname{I}^{\*}=\operatorname{K}^{% MW}\_{\*}/h\}. |  |

Given an S-scheme X (essentially of finite type) and a line bundle \mathcal{L} over X,
we can then use the definition of 3.3.7 and introduce the homology of X with coefficients in M and twist \mathcal{L},
over S:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.1.b) |  | \displaystyle C\_{p}(X/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) | \displaystyle:=C\_{p}(X,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) | \displaystyle:=\bigoplus\_{x\in X\_{(p)}}M\_{q+p}(\kappa(x),\lambda\_{x}\otimes% \mathcal{L}\_{x}), |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.1.c) |  | \displaystyle A\_{p}(X/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) | \displaystyle:=H\_{p}\big{(}C\_{\*}(X/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L})\big{)} | \displaystyle:=H\_{p}\big{(}C\_{\*}(X,M\_{q},\mathcal{L})\big{)}. |  |

While it is possible to follow the conventions of 3.4.7, we have chosen to indicate the base scheme S in the notations here, seeing this theory as the Borel-Moore theory of X/S with coefficients in the MW-homodule \mathcal{M}=\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}\_{\lambda}(M) defined over S.
161616Beware however that it is not clear that the bigraded theory A\_{\*}(X/S,M,\mathcal{L})
satisfies the axioms of a twisted bivariant theory as in [DJK21]: one misses the
arbitrary base change map in S, though it can be defined for slci (or flat) morphisms
(see [FJ25]). In a forthcoming work, we will establish such a formalism in full generality by showing the representability of this theory in the motivic stable homotopy category, and clarify its relations with the (perverse) homotopy t-structure.
Recall that when M is oriented (e.g. M\in\{\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*},2\operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*}\}),
the group A\_{p}(X/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}) can be defined without assuming the existence of a pinning: see 3.5.11; in the presence of a pinning, it does not depend on \mathcal{L} or on the choice of pinning. Finally, in the case M=\operatorname{W}, the above group does not depend on q,
and we will simply write:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (4.1.1.d) |  | A^{p}(X/S,\operatorname{W},\mathcal{L})=A^{p}(X/S,\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{q}[% \eta^{-1}],\mathcal{L}),\text{ any }q\in\mathbf{Z}. |  |

In any case, the above theory satisfies the following functoriality properties,
for \pi:X^{\prime}\rightarrow X proper and f:Y\rightarrow X lci smoothable:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\pi\_{\*}: | \displaystyle A\_{p}(X^{\prime}/S,M\_{q},\pi^{\*}\mathcal{L})\rightarrow A\_{p}(X/% S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L}), |  | |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle f^{!}: | \displaystyle A\_{p}(X/S,M\_{q},\mathcal{L})\rightarrow A\_{p+d}(Y/S,M\_{q},\omega% \_{f}\otimes f^{\*}\mathcal{L}), | 2.2.5. |  |

Moreover, one has the *localization exact sequence* (1.5.8.a)
associated with any closed immersion i:Z\rightarrow X of S-schemes.
