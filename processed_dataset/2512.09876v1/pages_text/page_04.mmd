Let R be a Dedekind domain of finite type over \mathbf{Z}, K its function field, and
r the number of real places of K, L an invertible R-module. Put X=\operatorname{Spec}(R),
\mathcal{L}=\operatorname{Spec}\big{(}\mathrm{Sym}(L^{\vee})\big{)}. Then one gets:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A\_{0}(X,\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{q},\mathcal{L})=\begin{cases}0&q>0,\\ \operatorname{Cl}(R)&q=0,\\ \operatorname{Cl}(R)/2&q<0,\end{cases} | A\_{1}(X,\operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{q},\mathcal{L})=\begin{cases}\underline{% \operatorname{W}}(R,L)&q<0,\\ \underline{\operatorname{GW}}(R,L)&q=0,\\ \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{1}(R,L)&q=1,\\ \mathbf{Z}^{r}&q>1,\\ \end{cases} |

Moreover, one has short exact sequences:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow\underline{\operatorname{I}}(R,L)\rightarrow% \underline{\operatorname{GW}}(R,L)\rightarrow\mathbf{Z}\rightarrow 0 |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle 0\rightarrow\underline{\operatorname{I}}^{2}(R,L)\rightarrow% \underline{\operatorname{K}}^{MW}\_{1}(R,L)\rightarrow R^{\times}\rightarrow 0. |  |

Here, \operatorname{Cl}(R) (resp. \underline{\operatorname{W}}(R,L)) refers to the class group of R (resp. the unramified symmetric Witt group of R).
The underlined group refers to unramified invariants, and we refer the reader to Proposition 4.4.17
for the explicit computation of \underline{\operatorname{I}}(R,L), \underline{\operatorname{I}}^{2}(R,L), which can be expressed in terms of the units of R,
and the unramified Milnor K-group of R in degree 2, two meaningful arithmetic invariants.

In fact, one also obtains a complete computation of the unramified (symmetric) Witt group \underline{\operatorname{W}}(R,L),
under the above assumptions. Besides, we show that *purity* for the (symmetric) Witt group holds for R, namely the canonical map

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{W}(R,L)\to\underline{\operatorname{W}}(R,L) |  |

from the L-twisted symmetric Witt theory to unramified Witt theory, is an isomorphism. This result gives a computation of \operatorname{W}(R,L) regardless of characteristics, and was previously known if 2 is invertible in R (see [BW02]). See Proposition 4.4.17 and Theorem 4.4.19 for details.

As an illuminating corollary of Theorem A, we deduce the following finiteness result which we further link with the Bass-Tate conjecture
