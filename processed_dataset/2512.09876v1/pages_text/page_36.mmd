Let \mathcal{O} be a 1-dimensional local domain which is essentially of finite type over S, with fraction field F and residue field \kappa. Then \mathcal{O} is an excellent ring. Let A be the integral closure of \mathcal{O}, which is regular, semi-local and finite over \mathcal{O}. Let \{z\_{1},\cdots,z\_{n}\} be the closed points of A, which correspond to valuations on F with residue fields \kappa(z\_{1}),\cdots,\kappa(z\_{n}) (indeed, the normalization morphism is finite because S is excellent). Denote by \phi\_{i}:\kappa\to\kappa(z\_{i}) the induced finite morphism of S-fields. We then define a map

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (3.5.4.a) |  | \displaystyle\partial\_{\mathcal{O}}:M\_{n}(F)\underset{\ref{itm:D4ori}}{% \xrightarrow{(\partial\_{z\_{i}})\_{i=1}^{n}}}\oplus\_{i=1}^{n}M\_{n-1}(\kappa(z\_{i% }))\underset{\ref{itm:D2ori}}{\xrightarrow{\sum\_{i=1}^{n}\phi\_{i\*}}}M\_{n-1}(% \kappa). |  |

   Let X be an S-scheme essentially of finite type, and let x and y be two points on X. We define a map

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (3.5.4.b) |  | \displaystyle\partial^{x}\_{y}:M\_{\*}(x)\to M\_{\*-1}(y) |  |

   as follows: let Z be the reduced Zariski closure of x in X, and if y\in Z^{(1)}, then the map (3.5.4.b) is defined as the map \partial\_{\mathcal{O}\_{Z,y}} in (3.5.4.a) associated to the 1-dimensional local domain \mathcal{O}\_{Z,y}; otherwise we put \partial^{x}\_{y}=0.

###### Definition 3.5.5.

Consider the above notation. An *orientable Milnor-Witt cycle module* over S
is an orientable Milnor-Witt cycle premodule (3.2.1) which in addition satisfies the conditions 3.5.5 and 3.5.5

(fd):
:   Finite support of divisors. Let X be an irreducible normal S-scheme with generic point \xi and let \rho be an element of M(\xi). Then \partial^{\xi}\_{x}(\rho)=0 for all but finitely many x\in X^{(1)}.

(c):
:   Closedness. Let X be a local, integral S-scheme of dimension 2, with generic point \xi and closed point x\_{0}. Then

    |  |  |  |  |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | (3.5.5.a) |  | \displaystyle 0=\sum\_{x\in X^{(1)}}\partial^{x}\_{x\_{0}}\circ\partial^{\xi}\_{x}% :M\_{\*}(\xi)\to M\_{\*-2}(x\_{0}). |  |

We also call such an object a *Milnor cycle module* over S, or simply *M-module*.
We denote by \operatorname{M-Mod}\_{S} the category of Milnor cycle modules over S.

###### Example 3.5.6.

According to 3.4.4(1), Milnor K-theory defines a Milnor cycle module
over any base scheme S equipped with a pinning.
This follows from the fact that \operatorname{K}^{MW}\_{\*} is a MW-module over such bases,
which follows the proof of [Kat86]. In fact, based on *loc. cit.*
one deduces that \operatorname{K}^{M}\_{\*} is a Milnor cycle module over any base scheme S, without requiring
the existence of a pinning.

In [Ros96], Rost introduced the notion of cycle modules,
focusing on schemes essentially of finite type over a given base field S=\operatorname{Spec}(k).
However, it is straightforward to extend all the definitions of *loc. cit.* to the setting of a base scheme S
equipped with a dimension function \delta,
which replaces the Krull dimension used by Rost.
In fact, our notion of Milnor cycle modules, as defined in 3.5.5, agrees with the original and the extended definitions
of Rost cycle modules:
