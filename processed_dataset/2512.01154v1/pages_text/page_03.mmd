The following propositions show the conditions what \theta needs to satisfy whenever O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) is an overlap function.

###### Proposition 2.1.

Let \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,+\infty] be a function with both \theta(x^{-}) and \theta(x^{+}) existing for every x\in[0,1] and \vartheta:[0,+\infty]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty] be a function. If the bivariate function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) |  |

is an overlap function, then the following two statements hold:

* (1)

  \theta is continuous in 0;
* (2)

  \theta(x)=+\infty if and only if x=0.

Proof.
(1) Supposing that \theta is not continuous in 0, we have \theta(0)\neq\theta(0^{+}) since \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,+\infty] is a function with both \theta(x^{-}) and \theta(x^{+}) existing for every x\in[0,1]. Thus there exists a u\in(0,1] such that \theta is continuous in (0,u]. Because O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) is an overlap function, it follows from Definition 2.1 (O2) and (O5) that \vartheta(\theta(0^{+})+\theta(u))=\vartheta(\theta(0)+\theta(u))=O\_{\theta,%
\vartheta}(0,u)=0. Moreover, there is a w\in(0,u] such that 2\theta(w)=\theta(0^{+})+\theta(u) since \theta is continuous in (0,u]. Thus O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(w,w)=\vartheta(\theta(w)+\theta(w))=\vartheta(\theta(0^{+%
})+\theta(u))=\vartheta(\theta(0)+\theta(u))=0 with w\neq 0, contrary to Definition 2.1 (O2). Therefore, \theta is continuous in 0.
(2) Assume \theta(0)\neq+\infty. Then from (1) there exists a u\in(0,1] such that \theta is continuous in [0,u] and \theta(u)\neq+\infty. So there is a w\in(0,u] satisfying 2\theta(w)=\theta(0)+\theta(u). Thus O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(w,w)=\vartheta(2\theta(w))=\vartheta(\theta(0)+\theta(u))=0 with w\neq 0, contrary to Definition 2.1 (O2). Therefore, \theta(0)=+\infty.
Conversely, it follows from the above proof that \theta(0)=+\infty. If there exists an x\_{0}\in(0,1] such that \theta(x\_{0})=+\infty, then O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x\_{0},x\_{0})=\vartheta(2\theta(x\_{0}))=\vartheta(+\infty)%
=\vartheta(2\theta(0))=0 with x\_{0}\neq 0, contrary to Definition 2.1 (O2).

From the proof of Proposition 2.1, the following remark is true.

###### Remark 2.1.

*Under the conditions of Proposition 2.1, \vartheta(+\infty)=0.*

###### Proposition 2.2.

Let \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,+\infty] be a function with both \theta(x^{-}) and \theta(x^{+}) existing for every x\in[0,1]. Then there is a function \vartheta:[0,+\infty]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty] such that the bivariate function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) |  |

is an overlap function if and only if the following four conditions hold:

* (i)

  \theta is continuous;
* (ii)

  \theta is non-increasing;
* (iii)

  \theta(x)=+\infty if and only if x=0;
* (iv)

  \theta(x)>\theta(1) for each x\in[0,1).

Proof.
(i) If \theta is not continuous, then there is a u\in[0,1] such that \theta(u^{-})\neq\theta(u^{+}) and from Proposition 2.1 (1) we have that \theta is continuous in [0,u). We just prove that \theta(u^{-})>\theta(u^{+}) leads to a contradiction, the case \theta(u^{-})<\theta(u^{+}) being analogous. Indeed, because O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) is continuous we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(u^{-}))=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(u^{+})) |  | (1) |

for each x\in[0,u). Meanwhile, from Proposition 2.1 (2) there exists an x\_{0}\in(0,u] such that \theta is non-increasing in [0,x\_{0}], and from \theta(u^{-})>\theta(u^{+}) we have \theta(x\_{0})+\theta(u^{-})>\theta(x\_{0})+\theta(u^{+}). Thus there is an x\_{1}\in[0,x\_{0}) satisfying

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \theta(u^{+})+\theta(x\_{1})=\theta(u^{-})+\theta(x\_{0}) |  | (2) |
