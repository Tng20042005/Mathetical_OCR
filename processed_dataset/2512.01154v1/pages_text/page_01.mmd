## 1 Introduction

Although triangular norms and triangular conorms are widely applied to these fields such as image processing, fuzzy logic, classification and decision making in the real world [11], their associativity is strongly required. To avoid this problem, arising from some practical applications in image processing, classification and decision making Bustince et al. introduced overlap and grouping functions [3, 4]. After that, overlap and grouping functions undergo a rapid development in two aspects included applications and theory. In applications, overlap and grouping functions are widely used to solve difficulties appeared in image processing [3], data stream clustering [21], convolutional neural networks [19], classification [1, 15] and decision making problems [20]. Accompanying with the development of applications, scholars all over the world also obtain remarkable progress in theory of overlap and grouping functions, such as their migrativity, cross-migrativitity, bimigrativity, homogeneity, idempotency, the Lipschitz condition and the existence of generators [2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 23].

It is well-known that additive and multiplicative generators play a significant role for building t-norms or t-conorms [13, 18, 22], so that it seems natural for us to consider the use of additive or multiplicative generators for the overlap and grouping functions. Moreover, the use of additive or multiplicative generators may simplify the choice of an appropriate overlap or grouping function for a given problem since we only need to consider one-variable functions instead of a bivariate one, reducing the computational complexity in this way [17]. Following this idea, Dimuro et al. [8] introduced the notion of an additive generator pair for a grouping function. Furthermore, they gave the concept of an additive generator pair for an overlap function and explored the overlap functions generated by additive generator pairs. Specific speaking, they gave the definition of an additive generator pair for an overlap function as follows.

###### Definition 1.1 ([7]).

*Let \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,+\infty] and \vartheta:[0,+\infty]\rightarrow[0,1] be continuous and non-increasing functions such that*

\theta(x)=+\infty *if and only if x=0;*

\theta(x)=0 *if and only if x=1;*

\vartheta(x)=1 *if and only if x=0;*

\vartheta(x)=0 *if and only if x=+\infty.
  
Then the function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1], defined by O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)), is an overlap function. (\theta,\vartheta) is called an additive generator pair of the overlap function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}, and O\_{\theta,\vartheta} is said to be additively generated by the pair (\theta,\vartheta).*

Based on Definition 1.1, we recently revealed the relationship between functions \theta and \vartheta in an overlap function additively generated by an additive generator pair (\theta,\vartheta), which is used to characterize the conditions for an overlap function additively generated by the pair (\theta,\vartheta) being a triangular norm by terms of functions \theta and \vartheta [16].
