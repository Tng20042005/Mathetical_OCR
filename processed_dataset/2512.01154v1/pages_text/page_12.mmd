\theta(x)=+\infty if and only if x=0;
* (4)

  For x\in[2\theta(1),+\infty], \vartheta(x)=0 if and only if x=+\infty;

  For a given a\in(-\infty,+\infty), the following two statements are equivalent:

  (ii) For x\in[a,+\infty], \vartheta(x)=1 if and only if x=a.

or the following five statements

* (1)

  \theta is continuous and non-decreasing;
* (2)

  \vartheta is continuous and non-decreasing in [-\infty,2\theta(1)];
* (3)

  \theta(x)=-\infty if and only if x=0;
* (4)

  For x\in[-\infty,2\theta(1)], \vartheta(x)=0 if and only if x=-\infty;
* (5)

  For a given a\in(-\infty,+\infty), the following two statements are equivalent:
  (i) \theta(x)=\frac{a}{2} if and only if x=1;
  (ii) For x\in[-\infty,a], \vartheta(x)=1 if and only if x=a.

hold.

## 4 Conclusions

The article mainly supplied the characterization of additive generator pairs of overlap functions (Theorems 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3). In particular, the purpose of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 together with Propositions 3.2 and 3.3 was to give us analytical expressions of some transformations for additive generator pairs. It regrets that we do not know whether the converses of both Propositions 3.2 and 3.3 are true.
