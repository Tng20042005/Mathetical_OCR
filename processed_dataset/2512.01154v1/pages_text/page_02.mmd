From Definition 1.1, a pair (\theta,\vartheta) which satisfies the conditions (1), (2), (3), (4) and the function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] defined by O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) is an overlap function is called an additive generator pair of the overlap function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}. Thereby, an interesting question arises: what does a pair (\theta,\vartheta) need to satisfy whenever the function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] defined by O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) is an overlap function?

In this article, we directly give the definition of an additive generator pair of an overlap function as follows.

###### Definition 1.2.

*Let \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,+\infty] and \vartheta:[0,+\infty]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty] be two functions. If the bivariate function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] given by*

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) |  |

*is an overlap function, then (\theta,\vartheta) is called an additive generator pair of the overlap function O\_{\theta,\vartheta} and O\_{\theta,\vartheta} is said to be additively generated by the pair (\theta,\vartheta).*

And we positively answer the above problem.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we characterize an additive generator pair (\theta,\vartheta) for the bivariate function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) |  |

being an overlap function when \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,+\infty] is a function with both \theta(x^{-}) and \theta(x^{+}) existing for every x\in[0,1] and \vartheta:[0,+\infty]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty] is a function. In Section 3, we give analytical expressions of some transformations for the pair (\theta,\vartheta) and further describe an additive generator pair (\theta,\vartheta) for the bivariate function O\_{\theta,\vartheta} being an overlap function when \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty] is a function with both \theta(x^{-}) and \theta(x^{+}) existing for every x\in[0,1] and \vartheta:[-\infty,+\infty]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty] is a function. A conclusion is drawn in Section 4.

## 2 Additive generator pairs of overlap functions

Let \theta:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,+\infty] be a function with both \theta(x^{-}) and \theta(x^{+}) existing for every x\in[0,1] and \vartheta:[0,+\infty]\rightarrow[-\infty,+\infty] be a function. In this section we characterize the pair (\theta,\vartheta) for the bivariate function O\_{\theta,\vartheta}:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | O\_{\theta,\vartheta}(x,y)=\vartheta(\theta(x)+\theta(y)) |  |

being an overlap function.

###### Definition 2.1 ([3]).

*A bivariate function O:[0,1]^{2}\rightarrow[0,1] is said to be an overlap function if it satisfies the following conditions:*

* (O1)

  O is commutative,
* (O2)

  O(x,y)=0 if and only if xy=0,
