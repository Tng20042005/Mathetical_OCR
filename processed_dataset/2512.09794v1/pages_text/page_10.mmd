where \delta:=\alpha-\beta-(p-q)\frac{N-1}{p}<0 by assumption. Hence

Finally, the conclusion follows combining (3.22), (3.23) and (3.25).

## 4. Existence of solutions

###### Proof of Theorem 1.1.

Let us check the conditions of the Brezis-Niremberg lemma given in Lemma 6.1.

(i) Case \gamma=0. By (2.3), the underlying space is W^{s,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}). Let u such that \|u\|\_{s,p,\beta}\ll 1. Then, by Theorem 3.7,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\mathcal{J}(u) | \displaystyle=\frac{1}{p}[u]\_{s,p}^{p}+\frac{1}{p}\|u\|\_{p,\beta}^{p}-\frac{1}% {q}\|u\|\_{q,\alpha}^{q} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq\frac{1}{p}\left([u]\_{s,p}^{p}+\|u\|\_{p,\beta}^{p}\right)-C\|% u\|\_{s,p,\beta}^{q} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq\frac{1}{p2^{p}}\left([u]\_{s,p}+\|u\|\_{p,\beta}\right)^{p}-C% \|u\|\_{s,p,\beta}^{q}=\frac{1}{p2^{p}}\|u\|\_{s,p,\beta}^{p}-C\|u\|\_{s,p,\beta}% ^{q} |  |

where we have used that a^{p}+b^{p}\geq\max\{a^{p},b^{p}\}\geq(\frac{a+b}{2})^{p}. Since p<q, we have that \mathcal{J}(u)>0 for \|u\|\_{s,p,\beta}=r small enough.

Similarly, when \gamma\in(0,1], by (2.3), the underlying space is now W^{1,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}). Hence, using Theorem 3.7 yields

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\mathcal{J}(u) | \displaystyle=\frac{\gamma}{p}\|\nabla u\|\_{p}^{p}+\frac{1-\gamma}{p}[u]\_{s,p}% ^{p}+\frac{1}{p}\|u\|\_{p,\beta}^{p}-\frac{1}{q}\|u\|\_{\alpha,q}^{q} |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq\frac{\gamma}{p}\left(\|\nabla u\|\_{p}^{p}+\|u\|\_{p,\beta}^{p% }\right)-C\|
