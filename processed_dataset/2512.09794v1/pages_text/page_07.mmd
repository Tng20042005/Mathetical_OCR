for all radial v\in H^{s^{\prime},p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}). Recall that H^{s^{\prime},p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) denotes the Bessel potential space. Since s^{\prime}<s, by Theorem 11.1 in [1], the following inclusion holds:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\subset H^{s^{\prime},p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\quad\text{with% continuity}. |  |

Thus, from (3.11), we conclude (3.6). This ends the proof.

Next, we prove a continuity embedding between the spaces W^{s,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) and L^{q}\_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{N}), for any p<q<\frac{p(N+\alpha)}{N-sp}.

###### Lemma 3.6.

Let s\in(0,1] such that 1/p<s<N/p, -sp<\alpha and p<q<\frac{p(N+\alpha)}{N-sp}. Moreover, assume that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.12) |  | \alpha-\beta+(q-p)\left(\dfrac{1-N}{p}\right)<0. |  |

Then, for any u\in W^{s,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}), there holds

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.13) |  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|u|^{q}\,dx\leq C\|u\|\_{s,p}^{\eta}\|u\|\_{p,% \beta}^{\omega}, |  |

for some \eta,\omega>0 depending on N,p,q and s.

###### Proof.

Let \varepsilon>0. Since q<\frac{p(N+\alpha)}{N-sp}, by Lemma 3.5, there is c<\alpha such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.14) |  | \left(\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{c}|u|^{q}\,dx\right)^{1/q}\leq C\|u\|\_{{s,p}}. |  |

Now,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.15) |  | \int\_{|x|\leq\varepsilon}|x|^{\alpha}|u|^{q}\,dx=\int\_{|x|\leq\varepsilon}|x|^% {\alpha-c}|x|^{c}|u|^{q}\,dx\leq C\varepsilon^{\alpha-c}\|u\|^{q}\_{s,p}. |  |

Next, by Strauss’ Lemma 3.1 and Remark 3.2, we get that
