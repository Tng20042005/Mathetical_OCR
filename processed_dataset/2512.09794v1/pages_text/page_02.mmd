A nonlocal version of (1.2) was studied in [16] for the fractional Laplacian with \beta=2, namely,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.3) |  | (-\Delta)^{s}u+|x|^{2}u=|x|^{\alpha}u^{q-1}\text{ in }\mathbb{R}^{N},\qquad u>0. |  |

In that work, it was shown that for \frac{1}{2}<s<\frac{N}{2} and q>1, under the condition -N+(\frac{N}{2}-s)q<\alpha<2+(q-2)(\frac{N}{2}-s), there exists a positive radially symmetric solution to (1.2) that decays to zero at infinity. We note, however, that the technique used in [16] requires
\beta=2, and moreover, the resulting range for \alpha does not coincide with the corresponding formula in the local case.

A similar result was proved in [6, Corollary 5.5], where existence of a radial weak solution of (1.3) is guaranteed when \frac{N}{2}<s, q<\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N-2s} and \alpha+\frac{q(1-2s)-2}{2s}<\frac{s}{2}(q-2)(N-1). Moreover, the author in [6] gives a condition for the existence of solution when the right hand side |x|^{2}u is replaced by |x|^{\beta}u^{p-1}, namely, \beta(q-2-2sq)+\alpha(2sp-p+2)<2s(p-q)(N-1) for \max\{2,p\}<q<\frac{2(N+\alpha)}{N-2s}.

The goal of this article is to extend existence results for Hénon-type equations in \mathbb{R}^{N} to operators exhibiting both local and nonlocal behavior, namely,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.4) |  | \begin{cases}\mathcal{L}\_{s,p,\gamma}\,u+|x|^{\beta}|u|^{p-2}u=|x|^{\alpha}|u|% ^{q-2}u\quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^{N},\\ u>0,\end{cases} |  |

where u belongs to a suitable functional space of radial functions \mathcal{W}^{s,p}\_{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) defined in Section 2 (see (2.3)). For s\in(0,1] and \gamma\in[0,1], for a function u smooth enough, the operator \mathcal{L}\_{s,p,\gamma} is given by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{L}\_{s,p,\gamma}\,u:=\gamma(-\Delta)\_{p}u+(1-\gamma)(-\Delta)\_{p}^{s}u. |  |

This operator is a mixed local–nonlocal operator, reducing to the classical
p-Laplacian when \gamma=1, and to the fractional p-Laplacian when \gamma=0. In the linear case (that is, p=2) it admits a probabilistic interpretation: the local component corresponds to the continuous part of the dynamics, while the nonlocal component models jump behavior.

The existence and qualitative properties of solutions for mixed local–nonlocal operators with nonlinear terms is an active area of research. Related results on bounded domains can be found, for instance, in [21, 4, 5, 14, 17, 12, 25].

Our primary goal is to study the existence of weak solutions to (1.4), defined variationally via the corresponding energy functional.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.5) |  | \mathcal{J}(u)=\frac{\gamma}{p}\|\nabla u\|\_{p}^{p}+\frac{1-\gamma}{p}[u]\_{s,p% }^{p}+\frac{1}{p}\|u\|\_{p,\beta}^{p}-\frac{1}{q}\|u\|\_{q,\alpha}^{q} |  |

defined on a suitable space \mathcal{W}^{s,p}\_{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}), where \|u\|\_{\beta,p}^{p} denotes the integral \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\beta}|u|^{p}\,dx, and [u]\_{s,p} is the so-called Gagliardo seminorm (see Section 2 for precise definitions). Indeed, \mathcal{J} is a C^{1} functional whose Frechét derivative is given by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\langle\mathcal{J}^{\prime}(u),v\rangle | \displaystyle=\gamma\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}\Phi\_{p}(\nabla u)\cdot\nabla v\,dx+(% 1-\gamma)\iint\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}\times\mathbb{R}^{N}}\frac{\Phi\_{p}(u(x)-u(y))(v% (x)-v(y))}{|x-y|^{N+sp}}\,dxdy |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\quad+\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\beta}\Phi\_{p}(u)v\,dx-\int\_{% \mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}\Phi\_{q}(u)v\,dx\qquad\forall u,v\in\mathcal{W}^{s,% p}\_{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}), |  |

where \Phi\_{p}(t):=|t|^{p-2}t. Therefore, any critical point of \mathcal{J} is a weak solution of (1.4).

Our first result establishes a range of parameters for which a weak solution of (1.4) exists. For further reference, we let for \gamma\in[0,1],

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | p^{\*}\_{\gamma,s,\alpha}:=\begin{cases}\frac{p(N+\alpha)}{N-sp},\quad\text{if }% \gamma=0,\\ \frac{p(N+\alpha)}{N-p},\quad\text{if }\gamma\in(0,1].\end{cases} |  |

Precisely, we have:

###### Theorem 1.1.

Let s\in(0,1] such that 1/p<s<N/p, \alpha>-sp and p<q<p^{\*}\_{\gamma,s,\alpha}. Moreover, assume that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1.6) |  | \alpha-\beta+(q-p)\left(\dfrac{1-N}{p}\right)<0. |  |

Then, problem (1.4) admits a radial weak solution.
