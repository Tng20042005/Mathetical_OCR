## 3. Behavior of functions in W^{s,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N})

The Strauss Radial Lemma is a powerful tool that quantifies the decay of radial functions at infinity. The following version is derived from Theorems 10 and 13 in [22].

###### Lemma 3.1 (Strauss’ Lemma).

Assume 1/p<s\leq 1 and sp<N. Then, there is a constant C>0 such that for any u\in W^{s,p}\_{rad}(\mathbb{R}^{N}),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.1) |  | |u(x)|\leq C|x|^{(1-N)/p}\|u\|\_{s,p}, |  |

for all x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}.

###### Remark 3.2.

We observe that in the previous lemma, we may replace the norm \|u\|\_{s,p} with the norm \|u\|\_{s,p,\beta}. Indeed, for u\in W\_{\beta}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) with compact support,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.2) |  | \begin{split}\|u\|^{p}\_{p}&=\int\_{|x|<1}|u|^{p}\,dx+\int\_{|x|\geq 1}|u|^{p}\,% dx\\ &\leq\left(\int\_{|x|<1}|u|^{p^{\*}}\right)^{p/p^{\*}}\left(|B|\right)^{N/s}+\int% \_{|x|\geq 1}|x|^{\beta}|u|^{p}\,dx\\ &\leq C(N,s)\|u\|^{p}\_{L^{p^{\*}}(\mathbb{R}^{N})}+\||x|^{\beta/p}u\|^{p}\_{p}\\ &\leq C(N,s,p)[u]\_{s,p}^{p}+\||x|^{\beta/p}u\|^{p}\_{p}\leq C\|u\|^{p}\_{s,p,% \beta},\end{split} |  |

where we have used the inequality ([8, Theorem 6.5])

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|u\|^{p}\_{L^{p^{\*}}(\mathbb{R}^{N})}\leq C(N,s,p)[u]\_{s,p}^{p}. |  |

By density, this proves that \|u\|\_{s,p}\leq C\|u\|\_{s,p,\beta} in W\_{\beta}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) and the continuity of the embedding W\_{\beta}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\subset W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}).

###### Remark 3.3.

Recall that (see for instance [9, Lemma 4.2]), for u\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}), 1\leq p<\infty and s\in(0,1), it holds that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.3) |  | [u]\_{s,p}^{p}\leq\frac{N\omega\_{N}}{p}\left(\frac{2^{p}}{s}\|u\|\_{p}^{p}+\frac% {1}{1-s}\|\nabla u\|\_{p}^{p}\right). |  |

Then, by (3.3) and Remark 3.2,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.4) |  | [u]\_{s,p}^{p}\leq C(\|u\|\_{p}^{p}+\|\nabla u\|\_{p}^{p})\leq C(\|u\|\_{1,p,\beta% }^{p}+\|\nabla u\|\_{p}^{p})\leq C\|u\|\_{1,p,\beta}^{p}. |  |

We quote the following continuity embedding from [7, Theorem 6.2]:

###### Lemma 3.4.

Let 0<s<N/p, c>-N, (1-sp)c\leq(N-1)ps and let q=\frac{p(N+c)}{N-sp}. Then, there is C>0 such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.5) |  | \left(\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{c}|u|^{q}\,dx\right)^{1/q}\leq C\|u\|\_{H^{s,p}}, |  |

for all radial u\in H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}).

Here \|u\|\_{H^{s,p}} denotes the norm of u in the Bessel potential space H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) (see, for instance, [1] for a precise definition). We next show that we may replace \|u\|\_{H^{s,p}} in the previous lemma by the norm \|u\|\_{s,p}.

###### Lemma 3.5.
