Suppose that \{u\_{n}\}\_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset W^{s,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) and u\_{n}\rightharpoonup 0. Let M>0 such that \|u\|\_{s,p,\beta}\leq M. Given \varepsilon\in(0,1], we write

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.21) |  | \|u\_{n}\|^{q}\_{q,\alpha}=\int\_{|x|<\varepsilon}|u\_{n}|^{q}|x|^{\alpha}\,dx+% \int\_{\varepsilon\leq|x|<1/\varepsilon}|u\_{n}|^{q}|x|^{\alpha}\,dx+\int\_{|x|% \geq 1/\varepsilon}|u\_{n}|^{q}|x|^{\alpha}\,dx:=(i)+(ii)+(iii). |  |

Regarding (i), we first observe that since q<\frac{p(N+\alpha)}{N-sp}, then by Lemma 3.5 that there is c\in(-sp,\alpha) such that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | q=\frac{p(N+c)}{N-sp} |  |

and

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{c}|u\_{n}|^{q}\,dx\leq C\|u\_{n}\|^{q}\_{s,p}\leq C\|u\_% {n}\|\_{s,p,\beta}^{q}\leq CM^{q}, |  |

where we have appeal to Remark 3.2. Hence,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.22) |  | (i)=\int\_{|x|<\varepsilon}|x|^{\alpha-c}|x|^{c}|u\_{n}|^{q}\,dx\leq C% \varepsilon^{\alpha-c}M^{q}. |  |

To deal with (ii), we let \Omega\_{\varepsilon}:=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{N}:\varepsilon\leq|x|<\varepsilon%
^{-1}\right\}. Observe that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{\Omega\_{\varepsilon}}|u\_{n}|^{p}\,dx=\int\_{\Omega\_{\varepsilon}}|x|^{-% \beta}|x|^{\beta}|u\_{n}|^{p}\,dx\leq\varepsilon^{-\beta}\int\_{\Omega\_{% \varepsilon}}|x|^{\beta}|u\_{n}|^{p}\,dx\leq M^{p}\varepsilon^{-\beta}. |  |

By Remark 3.2 and the compact embedding W^{s,p}\subset L^{p} in bounded domains (see, for instance [8, Theorem 7.1]), it follows, up to a subsequence that we do not relabel, that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | u\_{n}\to 0\quad\text{in }L^{p}(\Omega\_{\varepsilon}). |  |

Thus, by Lemma 3.1

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.23) |  | (ii)\leq C(\varepsilon)\|u\_{n}\|\_{L^{\infty}(\Omega\_{\varepsilon})}^{q-p}\int\_% {\Omega\_{\varepsilon}}|u\_{n}|^{p}\,dx\leq C(\varepsilon,M)\int\_{\Omega\_{% \varepsilon}}|u\_{n}|^{p}\,dx\to 0, |  |

as n\to\infty.

Finally, we apply the Strauss’ Lemma 3.1 to get
