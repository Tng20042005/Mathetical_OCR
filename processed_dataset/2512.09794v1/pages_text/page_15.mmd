| (5.4) |  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|u|^{q-1}w\_{k+1}\,dx\leq\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}% |x|^{\alpha}|(2^{k+1}-1)w\_{k}|^{q-1}(2^{k+1}-1)w\_{k}\,dx=C\_{k+1}\int\_{\mathbb{% R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|w\_{k}|^{q}\,dx, |  |

with C\_{k+1}=(2^{k+1}-1)^{q}. By Lemma 3.6 applied to w\_{k+1}\in\mathcal{W}^{s,p}\_{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) (recall also the notation (3.19)) and by (5.3) and (5.4),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.5) |  | \begin{split}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|w\_{k+1}|^{q}\,dx\leq C\|w\_{k+1}% \|\_{s,p,\beta}^{\frac{pe\_{2}+qe\_{1}}{e\_{1}+e\_{2}}}\leq C\_{k+1}\left(\int\_{% \mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|w\_{k}|^{q}\,dx\right)^{\frac{pe\_{2}+qe\_{1}}{pe\_{1}% +pe\_{2}}}=C\_{k+1}\left(\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|w\_{k}|^{q}\,dx\right)% ^{1+\delta}\end{split} |  |

for some \delta>0 since q>p. Therefore, by the numerical lemma [10, Lemma 13], we obtain that there is \varepsilon\in(0,1) such that if

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.6) |  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|w\_{0}|^{q}\,dx<\varepsilon |  |

then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lim\_{k\to\infty}\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|w\_{k}|^{q}\,dx=0. |  |

Hence, (5.2) implies \|u\|\_{L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{N})}\leq 1. Observe that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|w\_{0}|^{q}\,dx=\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{% \alpha}u\_{+}^{q}\,dx |  |

so the result is valid under the assumption

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}u\_{+}^{q}|x|^{\alpha}\,dx<\varepsilon. |  |

If now
\xi=\int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}u\_{+}^{q}|x|^{\alpha}\,dx>0 is arbitrary, then we choose C>1 large enough so that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (5.7) |  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}\left(\frac{u\_{+}}{C}\right)^{q}|x|^{\alpha}\,dx<\varepsilon. |  |

Moreover, u/C also satisfies (5.3) with an extra constant at the end. Hence, from the above argument

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|u/C\|\_{L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{N})}\leq 1\text{ or }\|u\|\_{L^{\infty}(\mathbb% {R}^{N})}\leq C. |  |

This ends the proof of the theorem.

## 6. Non-existence of solutions

We begin this section with the following computation, which justifies our use of the non-existence result [20, Proposition 1.4], originally stated for bounded domains. Given \lambda>1, we can write
