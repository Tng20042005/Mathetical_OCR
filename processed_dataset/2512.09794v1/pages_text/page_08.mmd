| (3.16) |  | \begin{split}\int\_{|x|>\varepsilon}|x|^{\alpha}|u|^{q}\,dx&=\int\_{|x|>% \varepsilon}|x|^{\alpha-\beta}|x|^{\beta}|u|^{q-p}|u|^{p}\,dx\\ &\leq C\int\_{|x|>\varepsilon}|x|^{\beta}|u|^{p}|x|^{\alpha-\beta}\left(|x|^{% \frac{1-N}{p}}\|u\|\_{s,p}\right)^{q-p}\,dx\\ &=C\|u\|\_{s,p}^{q-p}\int\_{|x|>\varepsilon}|x|^{\beta}|u|^{p}|x|^{\alpha-\beta+% (q-p)\frac{1-N}{p}}\,dx.\end{split} |  |

Condition (3.12) yields that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.17) |  | \int\_{|x|>\varepsilon}|x|^{\alpha}|u|^{q}\,dx\leq C\varepsilon^{\alpha-\beta+(% q-p)\frac{1-N}{p}}\|u\|^{p}\_{L^{p}\_{\beta}}\|u\|\_{s,p}^{q-p}. |  |

Therefore, combining (3.15) and (3.17),

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.18) |  | \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|x|^{\alpha}|u|^{q}\,dx\leq C\left(\varepsilon^{\alpha-c}% \|u\|^{p}\_{s,p}+C\varepsilon^{\alpha-\beta+(q-p)\frac{1-N}{p}}\|u\|^{p}\_{L^{p}% \_{\beta}}\|u\|\_{s,p}^{q-p}\right). |  |

Maximizing the auxiliary function

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | g(\varepsilon):=C\_{1}\varepsilon^{e\_{1}}+C\_{2}\varepsilon^{-e\_{2}}, |  |

with

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | C\_{1}=C\|u\|^{p}\_{s,p},\,C\_{2}=C\|u\|^{p}\_{L^{p}\_{\beta}}\|u\|\_{s,p}^{q-p} |  |

and

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.19) |  | e\_{1}=\alpha-c,\quad-e\_{2}=\alpha-\beta+(q-p)\frac{1-N}{p}, |  |

we finally get (3.13) with

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \eta=\dfrac{pe\_{2}+(q-p)e\_{1}}{e\_{1}+e\_{2}}\quad\text{and}\quad\omega=\dfrac{% pe\_{1}}{e\_{1}+e\_{2}}. |  |

Observe that \eta is positive since by (3.12),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \eta=\frac{p(\beta-\alpha)+(q-p)(N-1)+(q-p)(\alpha-c)}{e\_{1}+e\_{2}}>\dfrac{(q-% p)(\alpha-c)}{e\_{1}+e\_{2}}>0. |  |

This concludes the proof.

We are now ready to prove the compactness of the embedding W^{s,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N}) into L^{q}\_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{N}).

###### Theorem 3.7.

Let s\in(0,1] such that 1/p<s<N/p, \alpha>-sp and p<q<\frac{p(N+\alpha)}{N-sp}. Moreover, assume that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (3.20) |  | \alpha-\beta+(q-p)\left(\dfrac{1-N}{p}\right)<0. |  |

Then, the following embedding is compact

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | W^{s,p}\_{rad,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^{N})\subset L^{q}\_{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^{N}). |  |

###### Proof.
