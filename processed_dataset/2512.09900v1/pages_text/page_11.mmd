r, in the case of (n,0)- or (0,n)-Dehn fillings we obtain precisely the Coxeter groups \Gamma\_{n} or \Gamma^{\prime}\_{n} generated by reflections in the walls of P\_{n} or P^{\prime}\_{n}, respectively, as in Figure 2. Indeed, this gives only an extra relation (r\_{1}r\_{3})^{n}=e or (r\_{2}r\_{4})^{n}=e in the quotient, therefore giving a Coxeter group. Denoting the generators in the quotient by r\_{i,n} or r^{\prime}\_{i,n} in the case of (n,0)- and (0,n)-Dehn fillings, we obtain precisely the Coxeter groups \Gamma\_{n} and \Gamma^{\prime}\_{n}, generated by reflections in the walls of Coxeter polyhedra P\_{n} and P^{\prime}\_{n}. Combinatorially, these two sequences of polyhedra P\_{n} and P^{\prime}\_{n} are obtained from the polyhedron P by replacing a vertex v with a compact edge in only two possible ways, as shown in Figure 2.

As in the case of general Dehn fillings, such contractions of edges to infinity do not exist in higher dimensions (it was explicitly shown in [7, Theorem 4.2] for almost right-angled polyhedra).

Figure 2. Hyperbolic Dehn filling for Coxeter polyhedra: an ideal red vertex v in the middle can be replaced with a compact edge in two ways, see the red edges e (left) and e^{\prime} (right). Thus one obtains two sequences of polyhedra P\_{n} and P^{\prime}\_{n} converging to P as n\to\infty along with contracting red edges e,e^{\prime} to the vertex v.

### 2.6. Random walks

Let \Gamma be a countable discrete group acting properly discontinuously on a metric space (X,d) by isometries, and let \mu be a probability measure on \Gamma. Consider a random walk

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \omega\_{n}:=g\_{1}\dots g\_{n}, |  |

where the (g\_{i}) are i.i.d. with distribution \mu. We will say that a random walk (\omega\_{n}) has finite range if \mu has finite support, and we will call it non-degenerate if the support of \mu generates \Gamma as a semigroup.

Let o\in X be a basepoint. Let \mu^{\*n}=\underbrace{\mu\*\ldots\*\mu}\_{n\text{ times}} be the nth convolution of the measure \mu with itself. Then one defines:
