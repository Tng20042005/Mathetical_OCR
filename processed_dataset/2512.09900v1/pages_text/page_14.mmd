A very similar argument shows that H(\mu\_{\Lambda}^{\*n})\leq H(\mu\_{\Gamma}^{\*n}). Dividing the latter inequality by n and taking the limit \lim\_{n\to\infty}, we complete the proof.

### 3.2. Algebraic vs geometric convergence of hyperbolic lattices

Here we summarize several specific facts about algebraic and geometric convergence that we will need to prove our main theorems. For some of the claims, we did not find proofs in the literature, so we provide a detailed argument here, although all these facts are known. In particular, part (1) is stated by Kapovich in his book, see [20, Exercise 8.12]. Under the assumption that all \Gamma\_{n} are lattices, part (2) follows from [4, Prop. E.2.3] and [4, Prop. E.3.1], and part (3) follows from [4, Theorem E.4.8], as we explain in the proof below.

###### Theorem 3.2.

Let \Gamma\_{n},\Gamma<\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}), d\geq 3, be torsion-free discrete groups. Assume that \Gamma\_{n}\to\Gamma geometrically and \Gamma is a lattice. Then the following assertions hold.

1. (1)

   There exists N>0 such that for all n>N the manifolds M\_{n}=\mathbb{H}^{d}/\Gamma\_{n} have finite volume, i.e. \Gamma\_{n} are also lattices.
2. (2)

   If, moreover, \Gamma is a uniform lattice, or non-uniform but d\geq 4, then \Gamma\_{n} are eventually isomorphic to \Gamma, i.e. there is N>0 such that \Gamma\_{n}\cong\Gamma for all n>N.
3. (3)

   If d=3 and \Gamma is non-uniform, then there is N>0 such that for n>N each \Gamma\_{n} is obtained from \Gamma by hyperbolic Dehn filling and therefore \Gamma\_{n}=\rho\_{n}(\Gamma) which algebraically converge to the initial representation \rho(\Gamma)=\Gamma.

###### Proof.

All parts follow from the thick-thin decomposition and the tools of geometric convergence, but part (1) also requires some standard facts from algebraic topology. By assumption \Gamma is a lattice, and thus the thick part M^{\geq\varepsilon} of M, where \varepsilon\leq\varepsilon\_{d}, is compact by Proposition 2.6.

We will first consider the case where \Gamma is a uniform lattice, i.e. where the manifold M=\mathbb{H}^{d}/\Gamma is closed. Taking the compact set K=M, we obtain by Corollary 2.8.1 that there is N>0 such that for all n>N there exist the bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphisms \phi\_{n}:M\hookrightarrow M\_{n}=\mathbb{H}^{d}/\Gamma\_{n}. Then \phi\_{n}(M)=N\_{n} is a closed d-submanifold of the connected d
