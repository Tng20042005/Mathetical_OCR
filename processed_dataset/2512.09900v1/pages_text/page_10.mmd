### 2.5. Hyperbolic Dehn filling in the case of hyperbolic reflection groups

Generally, in the case of non-orientable manifolds or orbifolds, one can simply pass to the orientable double cover and then discuss the Dehn filling process and geometric convergence in the oriented case.
However, for discrete groups \Gamma generated by reflections in hyperplanes, the Dehn filling process deserves to be considered separately since it can be described more explicitly in terms of the corresponding Coxeter polyhedra. It turns out that the Dehn fillings \Gamma\_{n} obtained from \Gamma can also be forced to be reflection groups, whose fundamental Coxeter polyhedra P\_{n} converge to the polyhedron P by contracting a certain finite edge.

Let Q\subset\mathbb{H}^{3} be a finite-volume Coxeter polyhedron with an edge e with two finite vertices, and let the dihedral angle at e be \frac{\pi}{m} for some m\geq 6. Note that since m\geq 6, the dihedral angle at each edge adjacent to e in Q is \frac{\pi}{2}. By Andreev’s theorem [1, 2], there always exists a finite-volume Coxeter polyhedron Q^{\prime} of the same combinatorial type and with the same dihedral angles as Q except that the dihedral angle at e in Q^{\prime} is replaced with \frac{\pi}{n}. If n\geq m, we say that Q^{\prime} is obtained from Q via a \frac{\pi}{n}-contraction at e. Thus, we can denote the polyhedra with angle \pi/n at e by P\_{n}. Andreev’s theorem also allows to contract this edge e to an ideal vertex v\_{\infty}: combinatorially it means that we replace e with a vertex of valence 4 without changing the remaining combinatorics of the polyhedron. This contraction gives rise to a finite-volume Coxeter polyhedron P. We refer to Kolpakov [23] for more details on contractions of edges.

What is important to us here is that we can view P\_{n} as having been obtained from P via Dehn filling. Indeed, let v be an ideal vertex of P, and let v be the intersection of facets F\_{1},F\_{2},F\_{3},F\_{4} of P; see Figure 2, the middle. These facets intersect any horosphere centered at v in a Euclidean square, and therefore the corresponding reflections r\_{1},r\_{2},r\_{3},r\_{4} generate the parabolic reflection group

)\times(\nicefrac{{\mathbb{Z}}}{{2\mathbb{Z}}}\*\nicefrac{{\mathbb{Z}}}{{2%
\mathbb{Z}}}).

Note that the parabolic isometries a=r\_{1}r\_{3} and b=r\_{2}r\_{4} commute and generate a \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z} subgroup of \Gamma\_{v}. Algebraically, the (p,q)-Dehn filling in this case means the quotient by the normal closure of an isometry a^{p}b^{q}. Generally, it gives non-Coxeter groups because of the new relation (r\_{1}r\_{3})^{p}(r\_{2}r\_{4})^{q}=e. Howeve
