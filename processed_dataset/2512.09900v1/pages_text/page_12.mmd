Let us denote the support of \mu by S. Recall that any random walk on a non-elementary subgroup of \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}) will converge (see Maher–Tiozzo [26]) to the geometric boundary \mathbb{S}^{d-1}=\partial\mathbb{H}^{d}. Equivalently, this means that for \mathbb{P}-a.e. sample path (\omega\_{1},\omega\_{2},\dots) the limit \lim\_{n\rightarrow\infty}\omega\_{n}o=\omega\_{\infty}\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1} exists, where \mathbb{P} is the probability measure which comes from (S^{\mathbb{N}},\mu^{\otimes\mathbb{N}}) via the pushforward

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (g\_{1},g\_{2},g\_{3},\dots)\mapsto(g\_{1},g\_{1}g\_{2},g\_{1}g\_{2}g\_{3},\cdots). |  |

Thus, a random walk induces the (unique) hitting measure \nu\_{\mu}=i\_{\*}(\mathbb{P}), where i is the (\mathbb{P}-a.e. defined) mapping which takes a sample path (\omega\_{n})\_{n\in\mathbb{N}} to the limit \omega\_{\infty}\in S^{2}. Another way to express this definition is to write
