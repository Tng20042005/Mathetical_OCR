-manifold M\_{n}. This implies that N\_{n} is both an open and closed subset of the connected manifold M\_{n}, whence N\_{n}=M\_{n}. Thus, M\_{n} itself is a compact hyperbolic d-manifold diffeomorphic to M, and then the Mostow rigidity implies that \Gamma\_{n} is isomorphic to \Gamma for all n>N. This proves part (1) and (2) for the case of \Gamma being a uniform lattice.

Henceforth, assume that M=\mathbb{H}^{d}/\Gamma has finite volume and is noncompact, i.e. it has (finitely many) cusps. In this case, we can choose \varepsilon\leq\varepsilon\_{d} so that the thick part M^{\geq\varepsilon} is a compact connected manifold whose boundary components are closed flat (d-1)-manifolds F\_{i} (see Remark 2.7 based on Proposition 2.6). We will separately treat the cases d=3 and d>3. For simplicity, we can pass simultaneously to orientation preserving subgroups of \Gamma\_{n} and \Gamma; so without loss of generality we assume that all manifolds M\_{n} and M are orientable.

Consider the compact set K=M^{\geq\varepsilon} and the submanifolds N\_{n}=\phi\_{n}(K) for the bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphisms \phi\_{n}\colon K\hookrightarrow M\_{n} (which exist for all n>N for some N>0) from Corollary 2.8.1. The complement M\_{n}-N\_{n} has connected components C\_{i} each having the boundary flat components F^{\prime}\_{i}, diffeomorphic to closed flats F\_{i}; see Figure 3. One can show that each C\_{i} is an aspherical manifold based on the fact that M\_{n}, N\_{n}, and F^{\prime}\_{i} are all aspherical.

Case d=3. In this dimension, the situation is simpler: F\_{i} are just flat 2-dimensional tori T\_{i}. We will denote their images by T^{\prime}\_{i}. Since T^{\prime}\_{i} is the boundary of C\_{i}, by [27, Proposition 9.3.6] we have only two options.

(a) T^{\prime}\_{i} bounds a solid torus, so C\_{i} itself is a solid torus and therefore compact.

(b) T^{\prime}\_{i} is incompressible in C\_{i}, and hence \pi\_{1}-injective by Hempel [18, Lemma 6.1]. Since T\_{i} is \pi\_{1}-injectuve for M, we thus obtain that T^{\prime}\_{i} is \pi\_{1}-injective for the whole M\_{n}. Then T^{\prime}\_{i} is a cusp cross-section, since the subgroup \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}=\pi\_{1}(T^{\prime}\_{i}) of \pi\_{1}(M\_{n})=\Gamma\_{n} must preserve a point on the ideal boundary by [27, Corollary 4.2.4]. Hence, the entire C\_{i} is just a finite-volume truncated cusp of M\_{n}.

Thus, M\_{n} consists of the compact block N\_{n}=\phi\_{n}(M^{\geq\varepsilon}) and of several pieces C\_{i} each of them being either compact or finite volume. Then M\_{n} has finite volume.
