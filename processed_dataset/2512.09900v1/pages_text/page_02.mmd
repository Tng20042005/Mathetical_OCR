rank either. For example, if G is a semisimple Lie group with Kazhdan’s property (T), \Gamma<G is an infinite-covolume discrete Zariski-dense subgroup, and \mu is a symmetric probability measure on \Gamma such that \langle\mathrm{supp}\,\mu\rangle=\Gamma, then the Furstenberg measure \nu on G/P is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure; see recent preprints Lee–Tiozzo–Van Limbeek [25] and Kim–Zimmer [22].

We prove the singularity conjecture for large families of cocompact Fuchsian and Kleinian groups. To formulate the main result, we need to introduce some preliminary information.

The key novel idea of this paper is to geometrically approximate groups for which the singularity conjecture is proven by a sequence of other groups. Our results and methods rely on the theory of small deformations and geometric convergence of finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Geometric convergence is equivalent to the convergence in the Chabauty topology of subgroups of \mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{C}). On the other hand, small deformations mean the deformations of a certain representation and give rise to the algebraic convergence of representations of a given group. It is well known that among lattices in \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}), d\geq 3, only nonuniform lattices in \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{3}) admit small deformations (for uniform lattices it was proved by Weil [33], while for nonuniform lattices it is a result of Garland–Raghunathan [13]).

Nonuniform lattices in \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{3}) are usually not locally rigid, meaning that their small deformations are not conjugate to the initial representation, as was discovered by Thurston. The small deformations we discuss here do not lead, in general, to lattices or even discrete subgroups of \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{3}). However, Thurston’s hyperbolic Dehn filling theorem allows one to obtain lattices under certain parameters of such deformations. We discuss the relation between small deformations, geometric convergence, and hyperbolic Dehn filling in Section 3.2. Moreover, we note that for any geometrically convergent sequence of lattices \Gamma\_{n}\to\Gamma one can always choose measures \mu\_{n} on \Gamma\_{n} and \mu on \Gamma which “are compatible with each other”. This compatibility comes from the hyperbolic Dehn filling on the limit lattice \Gamma; for a precise definition, see Section 3.3. Here, we just highlight the fact that picking a single measure \mu on \Gamma is enough to “translate” it to measures \mu\_{n} on all but finitely many sequence elements \Gamma\_{n} such that all \mu\_{n} and \mu are pairwise compatible.
Finally, a measure \mu on a lattice \Gamma is non-degenerate if \Gamma is the group generated by the support of \mu.

###### Theorem 1.2.

For any geometrically convergent sequence \Gamma\_{n}\to\Gamma of torsion-free lattices \Gamma\_{n},\Gamma<\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{C}), where \Gamma\_{n} are not pairwise conjugate, equipped with any sequence of compatible, non-degenerate, finitely-supported measures \mu\_{n} and \mu, respectively, there exists a number N=N(\mu)>0 such that for all n>N the hitting measure \nu\_{\mu\_{n}} of the random walk on \Gamma\_{n} driven by \mu\_{n} is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the ideal boundary \partial\_{\infty}\mathbb{H}^{3}\cong\mathbb{S}^{2}.

In Section 2.4, we explain how the tools of geometric convergence and hyperbolic Dehn filling work for compact hyperbolic 3-orbifolds, i.e. for cocompact Kleinian groups not necessarily torsion-free. The orbifold version of Theorem 1.2 is the following.

###### Theorem 1.3.

Let \Gamma<\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{C}) be a non-uniform lattice such that each cusp of the (oriented) orbifold \mathcal{O}=\mathbb{H}^{3}/\Gamma is either a torus \mathbb{T}^{2} or a pillowcase S^{2}(2,2,2,2). Consider a sequence of lattices \Gamma\_{n} that geometrically converge to \Gamma. Then for any non-degenerate finitely supported measure \mu on \Gamma there is N>0 such that for all n>N the following conditions hold:

1. (1)

   The orbifolds \mathcal{O}\_{n}=\mathbb{H}^{3}/\Gamma\_{n} are obtained by hyperbolic Dehn filling of one of the cusps of \mathcal{O}.
2. (2)

   There exist finitely supported measures \mu\_{n} on \Gamma\_{n} compatible with the measure \mu on \Gamma.
3. (3)

   The hitting measure \nu\_{\mu\_{n}} of the random walk driven by \mu\_{n} is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the ideal boundary \partial\_{\infty}\mathbb{H}^{3}\cong\mathbb{S}^{2}.

###### Proof.

Follows from Section 2.4, including the hyperbolic Dehn filling theorem for orbifolds by Dunbar–Meyerhoff [10], Proposition 3.1, and from the last part of the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Here we provide a special but very natural version of our main theorem in the setting of hyperbolic reflection groups.
