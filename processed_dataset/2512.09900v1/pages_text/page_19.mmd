Therefore,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2\ell\_{n}\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}2\ell>h\geq h\_{n}. |  |

Hence, there is N>0 such that 2\ell\_{n}>h\_{n} for all n>N,
so \nu\_{\mu\_{n}} is singular for these values of n. \scriptstyle\blacksquare

### 4.2. Hyperbolic reflection groups and proof of Theorem 1.4

In this case, the proof is a simple (special) version of the proof Theorem 1.2. Indeed, if the edge e in Coxeter polyhedra P\_{n} is formed by facets corresponding to reflections r\_{1}^{(n)} and r\_{2}^{(n)}, our reflection groups satisfy: \Gamma\_{n}=\Gamma/N\_{n}, where N\_{n} is the normal closure of (r\_{1}r\_{2})^{n}\in\Gamma.
By Proposition 3.1, we have the inequality h\_{n}<h for all n. The conclusion of the proof remains the same as in Theorem 1.2. \scriptstyle\blacksquare

### 4.3. Fuchsian groups and proof of Theorem 1.5

For Fuchsian groups, the result is stated already in the setting of algebraic convergence. This allows to apply Proposition 3.1 directly and then again conclude in the same way as it was done in the proof of Theorem 1.2. \scriptstyle\blacksquare

## 5. Examples

Throughout this section, \Sigma\_{g,a,b} denotes an orientable surface of genus g\geq 1 with a punctures and b boundary components; if b=0, we will simply write \Sigma\_{g,a}, and \Sigma\_{g} denotes a closed genus-g surface.

### 5.1. Geometric convergence of infinite-covolume Fuchsian groups to a lattice

Let \Sigma denote an infinite-area surface of genus 1 with one funnel, i.e. infinite end, and let \alpha be a simple closed geodesic separating the funnel, see Figure 4. Cutting off the funnel along \alpha would give us a surface \Sigma\_{1,0,1} in the above notation.

To construct a geometrically converging sequence of infinite-covolume Fuchsian groups, we take a surface \Sigma\_{n} with the same topology as \Sigma, but replace \alpha with a closed curve \alpha\_{n} such that the length of \alpha\_{n} tends to 0 as n\to\infty. For sufficiently large n and an appropriate choice of \varepsilon>0, the thin part (\Sigma\_{n})^{\leq\varepsilon} of \Sigma\_{n} is the neighborhood of \alpha\_{n} (bounded by blue arcs, see the top of Figure 4). Then the thick part (\Sigma\_{n})^{\geq\varepsilon} has two connected components, one of them being the surface \Sigma\_{1,0,1}. Denote this component by T\_{n}. Taking the basepoints x\_{n}\in T\_{n} so that they “stay apart” (uniformly) from the geodesic \alpha\_{n}, we obtain the pointed Gromov–Hausdorff convergence of (\Sigma\_{n},x\_{n}) to (\Sigma\_{1,1},x) for some x\in{\Sigma\_{1,1}}. By Theorem 2.8, this is equivalent to the geometric convergence of \pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{n}) to \pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{1,1}), which acts as a lattice on \mathbb{H}^{2}. We note that the groups \pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{n}) and \pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{1,1}) are all abstractly isomorphic to \mathrm{F}\_{2}, a free group of rank 2.

Figure 4. Pinching the red geodesic \alpha on \Sigma\_{1,0,1} (top), we obtain the geometric limit being the once-punctured torus \Sigma\_{1,1} (bottom).

This geometric convergence can also be justified in the setting of the pointed Gromov–Hausdorff convergence of the corresponding Dirichlet fundamental polyhedra. Consider the Poincare disc model of \mathbb{H}^{2} with o the origin. We choose a metric on \Sigma\_{1,1} such that the Dirichlet fundamental domain D\_{\Gamma}(o) of \Gamma=\pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{1,1}) is the regular ideal quadrilateral shown in Figure 5 (right). Then we take another quadrilateral bounded by four pairwise disjoint geodesics such that all the common perpendiculars \alpha\_{n} between the adjacent (consecutive) sides have the same length, see Figure 5 (left). These red perpendiculars \alpha\_{n} project under the \Gamma\_{n}=\pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{n})-action precisely to the red geodesic \alpha\_{n} illustrated in Figure 4 (top). Shrinking simultaneously all these \alpha\_{n}, we obtain the pointed Gromov–Hausdorff convergence D\_{\Gamma\_{n}}(o)\xrightarrow{pGH}D\_{\Gamma}(o). By Theorem 2.8, this is equivalent to the geometric convergence of \Gamma\_{n} to \Gamma.
