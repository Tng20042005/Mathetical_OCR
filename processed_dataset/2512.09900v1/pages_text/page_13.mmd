We will be dealing with hyperbolic groups \Gamma acting on \mathbb{H}^{2} and \mathbb{H}^{3}, and in our setting, we can make use of the following powerful criterion. We cite it here in the version for geometrically finite actions from [14, Theorem 4.1], which extends the previous version [5, Theorem 1.5] for hyperbolic groups. In this context, a *Patterson-Sullivan measure* for the action of \Gamma on a \delta-hyperbolic space X is a quasiconformal measure on \partial X of dimension equal to the critical exponent v of \Gamma.

###### Theorem 2.13.

Let (X,d) be a \delta-hyperbolic, proper metric space, let \Gamma be a geometrically finite group of isometries of X, and let o\in X be a basepoint.

Let \mu be a non-degenerate measure on \Gamma with finite superexponential moment, let \nu be its corresponding hitting measure, and let \kappa be a Patterson-Sullivan measure on \partial X.

Then the following conditions are equivalent.

1. (1)

   The equality

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | h(\mu)=\ell(\mu)v |  |

   holds.
2. (2)

   The measures \nu and \kappa are in the same measure class.
3. (3)

   The measures \nu and \kappa are in the same measure class with Radon–Nikodym derivatives bounded from above and below.
4. (4)

   There exists C\geq 0 such that for every g\in\Gamma,

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | |d\_{G}(e,g)-vd(o,go)|\leq C, |  |

   where d\_{G} denotes the Green metric for the random walk driven by \mu.

###### Corollary 2.13.1 ([14], Corollary 4.2).

If \Gamma\curvearrowright X is not convex cocompact then \kappa and \nu are mutually singular.

In this paper, we are interested in X=\mathbb{H}^{d} and \Gamma<\textup{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}) a lattice.
In this case it is well known that the Lebesgue measure \lambda on \partial\mathbb{H}^{d} is a Patterson-Sullivan measure.

To see why, recall that if g\in\textup{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}) then (see e.g. [28, Proposition 3.9])

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \frac{dg\lambda}{d\lambda}(\xi)=e^{-(d-1)\beta\_{\xi}(go,o)}\qquad\forall\xi\in% \partial\mathbb{H}^{d} |  |

so \lambda is quasiconformal and, since \Gamma is a lattice, v=n-1.

The corollary then immediately shows that
if \Gamma<\textup{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}) is a nonuniform lattice and \mu an admissible, finitely supported measure on \Gamma, then the hitting measure \nu is singular with respect to Lebesgue, and moreover
h(\mu)<(d-1)\ell(\mu).

## 3. Auxiliary results

### 3.1. Inequality for the entropy

###### Proposition 3.1.

Let \Gamma be a discrete group, and N\triangleleft\Gamma its normal subgroup. Let \mu\_{\Gamma} be a probability measure on \Gamma and \mu\_{\Lambda} be the pushforward of \mu\_{\Gamma} to \Lambda=\Gamma/N through the homomorphism \varphi:\Gamma\to\Gamma/N. Then h(\mu\_{\Lambda})\leq h(\mu\_{\Gamma}).

###### Proof.

First, we note that \mu\_{\Lambda}(\gamma N)=\sum\_{h\in\gamma N}\mu\_{\Gamma}(h). Using the monotonicity of \log, we have
-\log\mu\_{\Lambda}(\gamma N)=-\log\left(\sum\_{h\in\gamma N}\mu\_{\Gamma}(h)%
\right)\leq-\log\mu\_{\Gamma}(h) and therefore
