Figure 5. When the length of all red arcs \alpha\_{n} (left) tends simultaneously to 0, the domains D\_{\Gamma\_{n}}(o) (left) shrink to the regular ideal quadrilateral D\_{\Gamma}(o) (right), and therefore D\_{\Gamma\_{n}}(o)\xrightarrow{pGH}D\_{\Gamma}(o).

### 5.2. Non-equivalence of algebraic and geometric convergence of cocompact Fuchsian groups

Consider an orientable closed surface \Sigma\_{g} with a separating closed geodesic \alpha on it such that it divides \Sigma\_{g} into the union of \Sigma\_{1,0,1} and \Sigma\_{g-1,0,1}, see Figure 6 illustrating the case g=3. Pinching \alpha gives rise to an infinite sequence of closed surfaces (\Sigma\_{g})\_{n} that geometrically converge to a once-punctured torus \Sigma\_{1,1}. We can justify it similarly to the previous example. Indeed, denote the corresponding geodesic on (\Sigma\_{g})\_{n} by \alpha\_{n}, where \mathrm{Len}(\alpha\_{n})\to 0. For sufficiently large n and an appropriate choice of \varepsilon>0, the thick parts (\Sigma\_{g})\_{n}^{\geq\varepsilon} have two connected components, where one of them, denoted by T\_{n} corresponds to the left piece (\Sigma\_{1,0,1})\_{n}. Taking the basepoints x\_{n}\in Th\_{n} so that they stay apart from the geodesic \alpha\_{n}, we obtain the pointed Gromov–Hausdorff convergence of ((\Sigma\_{g})\_{n},x\_{n}) to (\Sigma\_{1,1},x) for some x\in{\Sigma\_{1,1}}. By Theorem 2.8, this is equivalent to the geometric convergence \pi\_{1}((\Sigma\_{g})\_{n})\to\pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{1,1})\cong\mathrm{F}\_{2}, a free group of rank 2.

Figure 6. Pinching the red arc on \Sigma\_{3} gives a sequence (\Sigma\_{3})\_{n} that converges geometrically to the once-punctured torus \Sigma\_{1,1}.

On the other hand, all \pi\_{1}((\Sigma\_{g})\_{n}) are isomoprhic to \pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{g}), being a one-relator group of four generators, and thus, there are no surjections from \pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{1,1})\cong\mathrm{F}\_{2}, a free group of rank 2, onto \pi\_{1}(\Sigma\_{g}).

## 6. Concluding remarks and further questions

Our main results (Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.5) heavily rely on algebraic convergence, which is essential in the proof of Proposition 3.1. In dimension d=3, this convergence is equivalent to the geometric one, as follows from Theorem 3.2, part (3). On the other hand, in Section 5, we provide an example showing that there are geometrically converging cocompact Fuchsian groups that do not algebraically converge to the same limit. In Theorem 3.2, part (1), we also showed that infinite-covolume lattices in \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}), d\geq 3, cannot geommetrically converge to a lattice, while it can happen if d=2 (see an example in Section 5). These phenomena motivate the following questions which we state below.

Let \Gamma\_{n} be a sequence of finitely generated Fuchsian groups that geometrically converge to a lattice \Gamma<\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}). Assume that the measures \mu\_{n} are supported on generating sets S\_{n} (of \Gamma\_{n}) that converge geometrically to a generating set S of \Gamma such that for each sequence of generators s\_{n}\in S\_{n} converging to a generator s\in S, the corresponding numbers p\_{n} on s\_{n} also converge to some number p on s.

###### Question 6.1.

Is it true that h\_{n}\to h? Is it true at least when all but finitely many \Gamma\_{n} are lattices?

A positive answer to the first question aims to replace Proposition 3.1 in the proof of the singularity conjecture for groups that are geometrically close to a group for which the singularity conjecture is proven.

###### Question 6.2.

Assume that all but finitely many \Gamma\_{n} are infinite-covolume. Does it imply that the hitting measures \nu\_{\mu\_{n}} are singular with respect to the Patterson–Sullivan measure \kappa on \partial\mathbb{H}^{2}=\mathbb{S}^{1}?

Assuming a positive answer to Question 6.1, we can answer Question 6.2 in affirmative using the fact that h\_{n}\to h, \ell\_{n}\to\ell, and v\_{n}\to v (the convergence of critical exponents follows from [30] and [31] as explained in [21, Corollary 4.7 (b)]).
