which is a connected component of the hyperboloid \{x\in\mathbb{R}^{d,1}\mid(x,x)=-1\}. The Riemannian metric tensor g\_{\mathcal{H}} is defined as the restriction of the Lorentzian scalar product (\cdot,\cdot) on the tangent bundle T\mathcal{H}^{d}.
The hyperbolic distance function \rho\_{\mathcal{H}} then satisfies \cosh\rho\_{\mathcal{H}}(x,y)=-(x,y). The full isometry group \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}) is isomorphic to the index-2 subgroup \mathrm{O}^{\prime}\_{d,1}(\mathbb{R}) of \mathrm{O}\_{d,1}(\mathbb{R}) defined by the condition that every matrix A\in\mathrm{O}^{\prime}\_{d,1}(\mathbb{R}) leaves \mathcal{H}^{d} invariant. This group can also be identified with the projective orthogonal group \mathrm{PO}\_{d,1}(\mathbb{R})=\mathrm{O}\_{d,1}(\mathbb{R})/\{\pm\mathtt{id}\}. Totally geodesic lines (geodesics) and planes are the intersections of \mathcal{H}^{d} with vector subspaces of \mathbb{R}^{d,1}. Hyperbolic reflections in hyperplanes are linear reflections with respect to hyperplanes of \mathbb{R}^{d,1}.

The upper half-space model \mathcal{U}^{d} is defined as follows:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{U}^{d}=\{x=(x\_{1},\ldots,x\_{d})\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\mid x\_{d}>0\}\text{ % with a metric tensor }g\_{\mathcal{U}}=\frac{g\_{\mathcal{E}}}{x\_{d}^{2}}, |  |

where g\_{\mathcal{E}} is the standard Euclidean metric on \mathbb{R}^{d}. Totally geodesic planes (including one-dimensional lines) are, in this model, either vertical Euclidean half-planes or hemispheres orthogonal to the boundary hyperplane \{x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\mid x\_{d}=0\}.

In dimensions 2 and 3, it is useful to involve the complex plane in this model:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{U}^{2}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\mid\mathtt{Im}(z)>0\}\text{ and }\mathcal{U}^% {3}=\{(z,t)\in\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{R}\_{>0}\}. |  |

The orientation-preserving isometry groups of \mathbb{H}^{2} and \mathbb{H}^{3} are then identified with the groups of fractional linear (Möbius) automorphisms of \mathcal{U}^{2} and \mathbb{C}, respectively:
\mathrm{Isom}^{+}(\mathbb{H}^{2})\cong\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}) and \mathrm{Isom}^{+}(\mathbb{H}^{3})\cong\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{C}).

Any complete connected hyperbolic d-manifold is a quotient M=\mathbb{H}^{d}/\Gamma, where \Gamma<\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}) is a torsion-free discrete subgroup. If \Gamma has finite-order elements, then M is called a hyperbolic orbifold and \Gamma its orbifold fundamental group. The manifold (or orbifold) M has finite volume if and only if \Gamma is a lattice in the real Lie group \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}), i.e. \Gamma has finite-volume fundamental domain in \mathbb{H}^{d}. The orbifold M is closed if \Gamma is a cocompact (or uniform), i.e. if its fundamental domain is compact in \mathbb{H}^{d}.

### 2.2. Thick-thin decomposition

First, we will need some fundamental notions from Riemannian geometry.

It is well known that in any Riemannian manifold (M,g), given a point p\in M and a tangent vector T\_{p}M, there is a unique maximal geodesic \gamma\_{v}\colon I\to M, where I\subset\mathbb{R} is some interval containing 0, such that \gamma(0)=p and \gamma^{\prime}(0)=v. This allows us to define the exponential map from the tangent bundle TM to M as follows.

###### Definition 2.1.

Let \mathcal{E}=\{v\in TM\mid\gamma\_{v}\text{ is defined on }I\supset[0,1]\}. Then the exponential map \exp:\mathcal{E}\to M is defined by \exp(v)=\gamma\_{v}(1).

The exponential map is smooth, its differential at the origin of each T\_{p}M is the identity map, whence \exp\_{p}\colon\mathcal{E}\_{p}\to M, where \mathcal{E}\_{p}=\mathcal{E}\cap T\_{p}M, is a local diffeomorphism at the origin of T\_{p}M. Now we can define the injectivity radius.

###### Definition 2.2.

Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold. The injectivity radius \mathrm{inj}\_{p}M of M at a point p\in M is the supremum of all r>0 such that B(0,r)\subset\mathcal{E}\_{p} and \exp\_{p}\mid\_{B(0,r)} is a diffeomorphism onto its image.

Let us now return to the setting of complete hyperbolic manifolds M=\mathbb{H}^{d}/\Gamma, possibly of infinite volume. Since \Gamma acts properly discontinuously by isometries on the universal cover \mathbb{H}^{d} of M, one can reach the minimal distance between the preimages of p\in M in \mathbb{H}^{d}: this minimal
