distance D is equal to the length of the shortest homotopically non-trivial loop at p. Moreover, \mathrm{inj}\_{p}M=D/2. More precisely, denoting by \mathrm{disp}(\gamma) the minimal displacement of \gamma\in\Gamma, we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathrm{inj}\_{p}M=\frac{1}{2}\inf\{\mathrm{disp}(\gamma)\mid\gamma\in\Gamma-\{% e\}\}. |  |

Therefore, the injectivity radius of p\in M along a closed simple geodesic of length \varepsilon is precisely \varepsilon/2.

The following group-theoretic result, known as the Margulis Lemma, has broad applications in geometry and topology of hyperbolic manifolds.

###### Lemma 2.3 (Margulis Lemma).

For every dimension d\geq 2, there is a constant \varepsilon\_{d}>0 such that for all x\in\mathbb{H}^{d}, every discrete group \Gamma<\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{d}) generated by elements that move x at distance <\varepsilon\_{d} is virtually abelian.

###### Definition 2.4.

The constant \varepsilon\_{d}>0 from Lemma 2.3 is called the Margulis constant.

###### Definition 2.5 (Thick-Thin Decomposition).

Fix d\geq 2. For any complete hyperbolic d–manifold M and any \varepsilon>0, we define the \varepsilon–thick part

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{\geq\varepsilon}=\{p\in M\mid\operatorname{inj}\_{p}(M)\geq\varepsilon/2\} |  |

and the \varepsilon–thin part

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | M^{\leq\varepsilon}=\mathrm{clos}(M-M^{\geq\varepsilon}). |  |

Note that if there is a closed geodesic \alpha of length precisely \varepsilon, then \alpha\subset M^{\geq\varepsilon} but \alpha\not\subset M^{\leq\varepsilon}.

The central result on the thick-thin decomposition states (see [27, Theorem 4.2.14]) that if 0<\varepsilon\leq\varepsilon\_{d} (the Margulis constant), then the thin part M^{\leq\varepsilon} of any complete hyperbolic d-manifold M is a disjoint union of star-shaped neighbourhoods of cusps and of simple closed geodesics of length <\varepsilon. In fact, all closed geodesics of length <\varepsilon\_{d} are simple and disjoint. If d\leq 3 and M is orientable, then the thin part M^{\leq\varepsilon} consists of truncated cusps and R-tubes; see [27, Proposition 4.2.15].

The following fundamental fact (see [27, Proposition 4.2.17 and Corollary 4.2.18] or [4, Proposition D.2.6 and Corollary D.3.14]) about the topology of finite-volume hyperbolic manifolds plays an important role in this paper.

###### Proposition 2.6.

Let 0<\varepsilon\leq\varepsilon\_{d}. A complete hyperbolic d-manifold M has finite volume if and only if its thick part M^{\geq\varepsilon} is compact. Moreover, every complete finite-volume hyperbolic manifold M is diffeomorphic to the interior of a compact manifold with boundary that consists of closed flat manifolds. In particular, any orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume can be identified with a compact 3-manifold with boundary consisting of (finitely many) flat tori.

###### Remark 2.7.

It is known (see [27, Proposition 4.3.1]) that, given a finite-volume hyperbolic manifold M and any number L>0, there are only finitely many closed geodesics in M shorter than L. This allows us to choose \varepsilon to be small enough (namely, smaller than half the systole of M) so that the thin part M^{\leq\varepsilon} consists only of the cusp neighbourhoods and the thick part M^{\geq\varepsilon} is a compact manifold with finitely many flat boundary components, as shows Proposition 2.6. Such a thick part M^{\geq\varepsilon} is homotopy equivalent to M and is thus an aspherical manifold.
