Let \mathcal{O} be a complete, finite-volume, orientable hyperbolic 3-orbifold with at least one cusp. Each cusp admits a horospherical cross-section which is a closed Euclidean 2-orbifold \mathcal{F}. Thus, \mathcal{F} is either a nonsingular torus, a pillowcase (see Figure 1), or a turnover of
type S^{2}(n\_{1},n\_{2},n\_{3}) with \frac{1}{n\_{1}}+\frac{1}{n\_{2}}+\frac{1}{n\_{3}}=1:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathbb{T}^{2},\quad S^{2}(2,2,2,2),\quad S^{2}(3,3,3),\quad S^{2}(2,3,6),% \quad S^{2}(2,4,4). |  |

We recall that S^{2}(a\_{1},\dots,a\_{k}) denotes an orbifold with underlying topological space \mathbb{S}^{2} and cone points of orders a\_{1},\dots,a\_{k}.

Let \Gamma=\pi\_{1}^{\mathrm{orb}}(\mathcal{O}), and let \Gamma\_{u}<\Gamma be a maximal parabolic subgroup corresponding to a cusp; \Gamma\_{u} is precisely the stabilizer of a point u\in\partial\mathbb{H}^{3}. The cusp cross-section \mathcal{F} is naturally identified with the Euclidean orbifold \mathbb{E}^{2}/\Gamma\_{u}, and \Gamma\_{u} fits into a short exact sequence

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1\longrightarrow\Lambda\cong\mathbb{Z}^{2}\longrightarrow\Gamma\_{u}% \longrightarrow H\longrightarrow 1, |  |

where \Lambda is the subgroup of translations in \Gamma\_{u} and H is a finite subgroup of \mathrm{O}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}), the rotational holonomy of \mathcal{F}.

A cusp of \mathcal{O} is called *non-rigid* (or *flexible*) if its cross-section is \mathbb{T}^{2} or the pillowcase S^{2}(2,2,2,2), and *rigid* if its cross-section is S^{2}(3,3,3), S^{2}(2,3,6) or S^{2}(2,4,4). Equivalently, F is non-rigid if and only if it admits a nontrivial 1-parameter family of Euclidean similarity structures, i.e. if its Teichmüller space has positive dimension, and rigid otherwise.

For a non-rigid cusp, the subgroup of translations \Lambda\cong\mathbb{Z}^{2} in \Gamma\_{p} is well defined up to conjugacy. A *slope* on the cusp is, by definition, an unoriented isotopy class of essential simple closed curves on F in the orbifold sense. Group-theoretically, a slope determines a primitive element \lambda\in\Lambda, well defined up to inversion and the action of the finite holonomy H. One can therefore regard the set of slopes as the set of H-orbits of primitive elements in \Lambda modulo \lambda\sim\lambda^{-1}.

Topological Dehn filling on a torus cusp is just the usual operation from the manifold case: one glues a solid torus along the boundary component, identifying a chosen slope on \mathbb{T}^{2} with a meridian of the solid torus. In the orbifold setting one may more generally perform *orbifold Dehn filling* by gluing a solid toric orbifold whose core curve is a cone geodesic of order m\in\mathbb{N}; the case m=1 recovers manifold Dehn filling.

For a cusp with cross-section S^{2}(2,2,2,2), there is an analogous operation where one glues in a “solid pillow,” i.e. a 3-ball with two unknotted singular arcs labelled by \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}. This construction can be regarded as the quotient of the torus case by the elliptic involution on a 2-fold torus cover of the cusp. In this setting, a slope is represented by a simple closed curve on S^{2}(2,2,2,2) which separates the four order-2 cone points into two pairs, and Dehn filling identifies this curve with a meridian of the solid pillow.

In contrast, there is *no* nontrivial Dehn filling operation on a rigid cusp: no quotient of a solid torus has a Euclidean turnover as boundary, so one cannot topologically cap off a turnover boundary component by a solid toric orbifold. Thus, Dehn filling is only defined on cusps whose cross-sections are \mathbb{T}^{2} or S^{2}(2,2,2,2).

Fix a non-rigid cusp of \mathcal{O} with peripheral subgroup \Gamma\_{u}<\Gamma and translation subgroup \Lambda\cong\mathbb{Z}^{2}. Let \lambda\in\Lambda be a primitive element representing a slope on the cusp in the sense above.

  If the cusp cross-section is a torus, \mathcal{F}=\mathbb{T}^{2}, then \Gamma\_{u}=\Lambda\cong\mathbb{Z}^{2} and we may choose generators a,b for \Gamma\_{u} so that \lambda=a^{p}b^{q} for some coprime integers p,q.

  If the cross-section is the pillowcase \mathcal{F}=S^{2}(2,2,2,2), then we have the short exact sequence

  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  |  | 1\longrightarrow\Lambda\cong\mathbb{Z}^{2}\longrightarrow\Gamma\_{u}% \longrightarrow\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow 1, |  |

  and one may choose a presentation

  |  |  |  |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  |  | \Gamma\_{u}=\langle a,b,t\mid[a,b]=1,\ t^{2}=1,\ tat^{-1}=a^{-1},\ tbt^{-1}=b^{% -1}\rangle, |  |

  where \langle a,b\rangle\cong\mathbb{Z}^{2} is the subgroup of translations and t is the elliptic involution. A slope is again represented by a primitive element \lambda=a^{p}b^{q}\in\Lambda.
