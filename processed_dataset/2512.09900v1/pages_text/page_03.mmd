Let \Sigma be the Coxeter–Vinberg diagram on m vertices of a compact Coxeter polyhedron P\subset\mathbb{H}^{3} with a dihedral angle \pi/n, n\geq 6, at one of its edges e. By varying this parameter n with other dihedral angles remaining fixed, we obtain a sequence of compact Coxeter polyhedra P\_{n}\subset\mathbb{H}^{3} whose corresponding cocompact reflection groups \Gamma\_{n} (generated by reflections r^{(n)}\_{1},\ldots,r^{(n)}\_{m} in the walls of P\_{n}) satisfy the following conditions.

1. (1)

   \Gamma\_{n}\to\Gamma geometrically, where \Gamma is a cofinite group generated by reflections r\_{1},\ldots,r\_{m} in the walls of a 1-cusped polyhedron P\_{\infty} obtained from P\_{n} by contracting the edge e to a point v\_{\infty} on the ideal boundary \partial\mathbb{H}^{3}.
2. (2)

   Assume that the measures \mu\_{n} are
   defined by assigning probability p\_{i}>0 to the generating reflection r^{(n)}\_{i}, where 1\leq i\leq m and the p\_{i} do not depend on n. Then there exists a number N>0 such that for all n>N the hitting measure \nu\_{\mu\_{n}} of the finitely supported random walk on \Gamma\_{n} with distribution \mu\_{n} is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the ideal boundary \partial\_{\infty}\mathbb{H}^{3}\cong\mathbb{S}^{2}.

In the case of Fuchsian groups, the situation is different. In contrast to the Kleinian groups case, there are, in general, uncountably many deformations of lattices in \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{2}). Moreover, the algebraic and geometric convergence do not coincide even in the case of lattices in \mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{2}). See Section 5 for examples.

###### Theorem 1.5.

Let \Gamma be a non-uniform lattice in \mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{R})=\mathrm{Isom}^{+}(\mathbb{H}^{2}), i.e. a cofinite Fuchsian group, and \mu a non-degenerate finitely supported measure on \Gamma. Then for every sequence of cocompact Fuchsian groups \Gamma\_{n}=\rho\_{n}(\Gamma) algebraically converging to \Gamma=\rho(\Gamma), there exists N\in\mathbb{N} such that for every n>N, the hitting measure \nu\_{n}=\nu\_{\mu\_{n}} of \mu\_{n}:=(\rho\_{n})\_{\*}\mu is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on \partial\_{\infty}\mathbb{H}^{2}\cong\mathbb{S}^{1}.

We also note that there exist many small deformations of cocompact Fuchsian groups that are also cocompact Fuchsian. This allows one to extend Theorem 1.5 to uniform lattices in \mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{R}) that algebraically approximate those for which this theorem is proven, and one can thus continue adding more and more groups that satisfy the singularity conjecture.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1. Hyperbolic manifolds and orbifolds

The d-dimensional hyperbolic space \mathbb{H}^{d} is the unique connected, simply connected Riemannian manifold of constant negative curvature. It has several useful models, among which we are mostly interested in the hyperboloid model \mathcal{H}^{d} and the upper half-space model \mathcal{U}^{d}.

To describe the hyperboloid model, we consider the Minkowski space \mathbb{R}^{d,1}, i.e. \mathbb{R}^{d+1} equipped with a Lorentzian scalar product (\cdot,\cdot) of signature (d,1). Passing to the standard basis of \mathbb{R}^{d,1}, we can write
(x,y)=-x\_{0}y\_{0}+x\_{1}y\_{1}+\ldots+x\_{d}y\_{d}.
Then we set

| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{H}^{d}:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{d,1}\mid(x,x)=-1,x\_{0}>0\}, |  |
