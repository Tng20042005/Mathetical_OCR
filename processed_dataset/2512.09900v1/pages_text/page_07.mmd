Suppose that K\subset M is obtained from a compact lift \widetilde{K}\subset\mathbb{H}^{d} by projection \mathbb{H}^{d}\to\mathbb{H}^{d}/\Gamma. One can pick such \widetilde{K} in the Dirichlet fundamental polyhedron D\_{\Gamma}(o) for some point o\in\mathbb{H}^{d}. Then there is R>0 such that \widetilde{K}\subset B\_{\mathbb{H}^{d}}(o,R). Theorem 2.8 implies that there exist (K\_{n},r\_{n})–approximate isometries f\_{n}:(M\_{n},v\_{n})\to(M,v) with K\_{n}\to 1 and r\_{n}\to\infty as n\to\infty. This means that there is N>0 such that for any n>N we have r\_{n}>R and a diffeomorphism of domains in M\_{n} and M, where the selected domain in M covers the ball B\_{M}(x,r\_{n}).

#### 2.3.2. Hyperbolic Dehn filling

Let M be a 3-manifold with the (connected) torus boundary T=\partial M.

###### Definition 2.9 (Dehn filling).

A Dehn filling of M along T is the operation of gluing a solid torus D\times S^{1} to M via a diffeomorphism \varphi:\partial D\times S^{1}\to T.

The closed curve \partial D\times\{x\} is glued to some simple closed curve \gamma\subset T. The result of this operation is a closed manifold M^{\prime}. It is well known (see, for instance, [27, Proposition 10.1.3]) that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \pi\_{1}(M^{\prime})=\pi\_{1}(M)/\langle\!\langle\gamma\rangle\!\rangle, |  |

where \langle\!\langle\gamma\rangle\!\rangle denotes the normal closure of \gamma in \pi\_{1}(M). This gives a surjective homomorphism f:\pi\_{1}(M)\to\pi\_{1}(M^{\prime}) with kernel \ker f=\langle\!\langle\gamma\rangle\!\rangle.

We will say that our Dehn filling kills the curve \gamma. Fixing a basis \alpha,\beta for \pi\_{1}(T)<\Gamma, we can write isotopy classes (called slopes) of homotopically non-trivial unoriented simple closed curves on T as [\gamma]=\alpha^{p}\beta^{q} for some coprime pair (p,q). This gives a 1-1 correspondence between slopes and elements of \mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\}. Therefore, every number \frac{p}{q} corresponds to a Dehn filling that kills an associated slope [\gamma].

Now we need to understand what happens with hyperbolic structures when we perform a Dehn filling procedure. Recall that by Proposition 2.6 any oriented finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold M=\mathbb{H}^{3}/\Gamma with one cusp is diffeomorphic to a 3-manifold with the torus boundary. The following theorem shows that almost all Dehn fillings M^{\prime} obtained from M admit complete hyperbolic structures and therefore give rise to closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

###### Theorem 2.10 (Thurston’s hyperbolic Dehn filling).

Let M be a finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold with one cusp. Let \mathscr{M} be the set of all 3-manifolds obtained from M via Dehn filling. Then all but finitely many elements of \mathscr{M} are closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and \mathscr{M} contains sequences \{M\_{n}\} converging to M.

###### Proof.

For a complete proof of the first part of the theorem we refer to Martelli [27, Theorem 15.1.1 and Corollary 15.1.3]. The second (convergence) part can be found in Benedetti–Petronio [4, Theorem E.5.1].

###### Remark 2.11.

Denote by \rho\colon\Gamma\to\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb{H}^{3})\cong\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{%
C}) the initial embedding of \pi\_{1}(M)=\Gamma in \mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{C}). Then the above discussed homomorphism f\_{p,q}=f:\pi\_{1}(M)\to\pi\_{1}(M^{\prime}) leads to a deformation of the representation \rho into a (non-faithful) representation \rho\_{p,q}:\Gamma\to\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{C}), where \rho\_{p,q}=\rho^{\prime}\circ f with \rho^{\prime}:\pi\_{1}(M^{\prime})\to\mathrm{PSL}\_{2}(\mathbb{C}) being a faithful representation of \pi\_{1}(M^{\prime}) obtained in Theorem 2.10.

### 2.4. Hyperbolic Dehn filling of orientable hyperbolic 3-orbifolds

In the previous subsection, we discussed the hyperbolic Dehn filling for manifolds, however, this theory can be adapted to the broader setting of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds, which was done by Dunbar and Meyerhoff [10].
