On homology with \mathbb{Z}-coefficients we have H\_{d-1}(\mathbb{T}^{d-1};\mathbb{Z})\cong\mathbb{Z}, generated by the fundamental class [\mathbb{T}^{d-1}], while H\_{d-1}(\mathbb{T}^{k};\mathbb{Z})=0 since k<d-1. Hence
g\_{\*}[\mathbb{T}^{d-1}]=0\in H\_{d-1}(\mathbb{T}^{k};\mathbb{Z}),
and therefore

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | i\_{\*}[\mathbb{T}^{d-1}]=f\_{\*}g\_{\*}[\mathbb{T}^{d-1}]=0\in H\_{d-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}). |  |

Case 2: F is only virtually a torus. In this case, F is a closed flat (d-1)-manifold with a finite covering
p:\mathbb{T}^{d-1}\longrightarrow F.
The covering p induces a short exact sequence

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 1\longrightarrow\pi\_{1}(\mathbb{T}^{d-1})\cong\mathbb{Z}^{d-1}\longrightarrow% \pi\_{1}(F)\longrightarrow A\longrightarrow 1, |  |

where A is finite and \pi\_{1}(F) is a Bieberbach group, hence torsion-free.

Let \varphi=i\_{\*}:\pi\_{1}(F)\to\pi\_{1}(X). By assumption \varphi is not injective, so

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | K:=\ker(\varphi)\subset\pi\_{1}(F) |  |

is nontrivial. Suppose first that K\cap\pi\_{1}(\mathbb{T}^{d-1}) is trivial. Then the restriction of the projection \pi\_{1}(F)\to A to K is injective, so K embeds into the finite group A and is therefore finite. But \pi\_{1}(F) is torsion-free, so it cannot contain a nontrivial finite subgroup. This contradiction shows that
K\cap\pi\_{1}(\mathbb{T}^{d-1}) is non-trivial.

Thus, the composition

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \pi\_{1}(\mathbb{T}^{d-1})\xrightarrow{p\_{\*}}\pi\_{1}(F)\xrightarrow{i\_{\*}}\pi\_{% 1}(X) |  |

has nontrivial kernel, i.e. the induced map
i\circ p:\mathbb{T}^{d-1}\to X is not \pi\_{1}-injective. By Case 1, the induced map on (d-1)-dimensional homology satisfies

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (i\circ p)\_{\*}[\mathbb{T}^{d-1}]=0\in H\_{d-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}). |  |

On the other hand, since p is a finite covering of degree m>0, we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | p\_{\*}[\mathbb{T}^{d-1}]=m\,[F]\in H\_{d-1}(F;\mathbb{Z}). |  |

Therefore

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 0=(i\circ p)\_{\*}[\mathbb{T}^{d-1}]=i\_{\*}p\_{\*}[\mathbb{T}^{d-1}]=i\_{\*}\bigl{(}m% \,[F]\bigr{)}=m\,i\_{\*}[F]\in H\_{d-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}). |  |

Hence i\_{\*}[F] is a torsion element of H\_{d-1}(X;\mathbb{Z}). In particular, its image in H\_{d-1}(X;\mathbb{Q}) is zero.

###### Lemma 3.4.

If F=\partial X is the compact connected boundary of a connected d-manifold X and [F]=0 in the H\_{d-1}(X), then X is compact.

###### Proof.

We can work over the field \mathbb{Z}\_{2}=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} or over the field \mathbb{Q} if X is oriented.
Consider the double DX of X along the boundary. Applying the Mayer–Vietoris to the classical decomposition DX=A\cup B, where A\cap B=F\times(-1,1)\simeq F, and A and B are thickenings of X by the collars F\times(-1,0] and F\times[0,1), respectively, we obtain that [F]\in\mathrm{im}(\delta) where \delta:H\_{d}(DX)\to H\_{d-1}(F). Indeed, since F has dimension d-1, H\_{d}(F)=0, so the relevant part of the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 0\to H\_{d}(A)\oplus H\_{d}(B)\longrightarrow H\_{d}(DX)\longrightarrow H\_{d-1}(F% )\xrightarrow{j\_{\*}}H\_{d-1}(A)\oplus H\_{d-1}(B). |  |

Here j\_{\*} is induced by the inclusions F\hookrightarrow A and
F\hookrightarrow B. Identifying A and B with X, we can write

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j\_{\*}=(i\_{\*},-i\_{\*}):H\_{d-1}(F)\longrightarrow H\_{d-1}(X)\oplus H\_{d-1}(X), |  |
