###### Proof.

By construction, Z\_{Y} is a closed subset of the affine variety Z. The sphericity of Y implies that Z\_{Y} is isomorphic to A, which yields the required result by the Luna slice theorem; see [PV, Theorem 6.7, 6.8].

###### Proposition 2.

Retain the assumptions of Proposition 1. Then there exists a B-root subgroup on X\_{f} that moves Y.

###### Proof.

Corollary 3 yields Z\_{Y}\simeq A.
By Proposition 1 we have Z\simeq L\*\_{L\_{0}}N\_{z}. Since X\_{f}\simeq P\*\_{L}Z\simeq P\_{u}\times Z, the variety X\_{f} is isomorphic to the homogeneous vector bundle \mathcal{N}=P\*\_{L\_{0}}N\_{z} over P/{L\_{0}}.
Since P/L\_{0}\simeq P\_{u}\times A is affine, it follows that the space of global sections H^{0}(P/L\_{0},\mathcal{N}) is nonzero, hence by the Lie–Kolchin theorem it contains a nonzero B-semiinvariant section s.
Then s defines a B-root subgroup on \mathcal{N} by the formula (t;v\_{y})\mapsto v\_{y}+ts\_{y} where v\_{y}\in\mathcal{N}\_{y} for y\in P/{L\_{0}}\subset Y, s\_{y} is the value of s at y, and t\in\mathbb{K}.
By Lemma 2 we can extend the constructed action to the whole X fixing \partial X.
∎

###### Remark 1.

Since the variety P/{L\_{0}} is affine, the vector bundle \mathcal{N} is generated by global sections, that is, for any vector v\in N\_{y} one can find a section s\in H^{0}(P/{L\_{0}},\mathcal{N}) such that s\_{y}=v. This shows that by a \mathbb{G}\_{a}-action that is not nesessary B-normalized one can connect the spherical orbit Y (satisfying \mathbb{K}[N\_{z}]^{L\_{0}}=\mathbb{K}) with any G-orbit that contains Y in its closure.

When we are interested in B-root subgroups on a spherical variety, the situation becomes more rigid.

###### Theorem 4.

Let X be an affine spherical G-variety and let \partial X\subset X be a closed G-stable subvariety. Let Y be a G-orbit contained in X^{\operatorname{reg}}\setminus\partial X. Then for every minimal G-orbit Y^{\prime}\neq Y with the property \overline{Y^{\prime}}\supset Y there exists a B-root subgroup on X that preserves the boundary \partial X and connects Y with Y^{\prime}.

###### Proof.

Since B has an open orbit in X, it follows that the group B\_{L\_{0}}=L\_{0}\cap B has an open orbit in N\_{z}. This implies that N\_{z} is a spherical L\_{0}-module and hence has a finite number of B\_{L\_{0}}-orbits. Let U\_{L} be the unipotent radical of B\_{L} and also of B\_{L\_{0}}. Then the action of B\_{L\_{0}} on N\_{z}^{U\_{L}}, which reduces to an action of the torus T\_{L\_{0}}=B\_{L\_{0}}/U\_{L}, has a finite number of orbits. The latter implies that the T\_{L\_{0}}-weights of N\_{z}^{U\_{L}} (which are the highest weights of N\_{z} as an L\_{0}-module) are multiplicity free and linearly independent.

Since there are a finite number of L\_{0}-orbits on N\_{z}, they are all stable under homotheties, so the nonzero orbits are in bijection with L\_{0}-orbits in the projective space \mathbb{P}(N\_{z}). In particular, the minimal nonzero L\_{0}-orbits in N\_{z} are in bijection with the closed L\_{0}-orbits in \mathbb{P}(N\_{z}). By the Borel fixed point theorem, the latter are in bijection with B\_{L\_{0}}-fixed points in \mathbb{P}(N\_{z}), which correspond to highest-weight vectors in N\_{z} regarded as an L\_{0}-module. Given a highest-weight vector v\in N\_{z}, consider the corresponding B-semiinvariant section s with s\_{z}=v.
The fiberwise translation by s, which defines a B-root subgroup on X\_{f} takes the zero section (which corresponds to Y) to a dense subset in B\*\_{B\_{L\_{0}}}\mathbb{K}v\subset\mathcal{N}, which corresponds to the minimal G-orbit that properly contains Y in its closure.
