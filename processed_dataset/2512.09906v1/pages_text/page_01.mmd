###### Abstract.

Given a connected reductive algebraic group G with a Borel subgroup B and a quasiaffine spherical G-variety X, we prove that every G-orbit Y contained in the regular locus of X can be connected by a B-normalized additive one-parameter group action with any minimal G-orbit in X containing Y in its closure. As a consequence, we show that the regular locus of X is transitive for the subgroup in the automorphism group of X generated by G and all B-normalized additive one-parameter subgroups.

## 1. Introduction

Let X be an irreducible algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field \mathbb{K} of characteristic zero.
Every nontrivial action on X of the group \mathbb{G}\_{a}=(\mathbb{K},+) induces a one-parameter subgroup in the automorphism group \operatorname{Aut}(X), called a \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroup.
If in addition X is equipped with an action of an algebraic group F and R is a \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroup normalized by F, then we say that R is an F-root subgroup.

The variety X is said to be spherical if it is normal and admits a regular action of a connected reductive algebraic group G such that a Borel subgroup B\subset G has an open dense orbit in X.
In this situation, X automatically contains an open G-orbit; moreover, there are only finitely many G-orbits in X.
In the recent years, a study of B-root subgroups on spherical varieties was initiated in the papers [AA, AZ1, AZ2].
One motivation for studying B-root subgroups is related to the problem of describing the automorphism groups for complete spherical varieties. In this case, the connected component of the group \operatorname{Aut}(X) is algebraic, so a description of B-root subgroups on X enables one to describe the G-module decomposition of the Lie the algebra of \operatorname{Aut}(X). Indeed, every B-root subgroup induces a B-semiinvariant vector field on X, which is a highest weight vector of a simple G-module in the Lie algebra of \operatorname{Aut}(X).
The goal of this note is to prove the following theorem, which provides another motivation for studying B-root subgroups on spherical varieties.

###### Theorem 1.

Let X be a quasiaffine spherical G-variety and let Y be a G-orbit contained in the regular locus of X. Then for every minimal G-orbit Y^{\prime}\subset X containing Y in its closure there exists a B-root subgroup on X that connects Y with Y^{\prime}.

This theorem is a consequence of Theorem 4 below.

It follows from Theorem 1 that for a quasiaffine spherical G-variety X every G-orbit in the regular locus of X can be connected with the open G-orbit via a suitable chain of B-root subgroups, which yields the following corollary.
