Let X be a quasiaffine spherical G-variety and let \widetilde{G} be the subgroup in \operatorname{Aut}X generated by the images of G and all B-root subgroups on X.
Then the regular locus of X is a single \widetilde{G}-orbit.

In the case where G=B=T and X is affine (so that X is an affine toric T-variety), Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 were known from [AKZ].

This note may serve as a complement and further development of one of the main results of the preprint [Sha] (Theorem 3), which states that the regular locus of an affine spherical G-variety X is a single orbit of the subgroup in \operatorname{Aut}(X) generated by G and all \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroups. In fact, Corollary 1 gives an affirmative answer to [Sha, Question 1]. We remark that the strategy of our proof of Theorem 1 goes the same lines as that used in [Sha].

## 2. Preliminaries

Given an algebraic variety X, we denote by X^{\operatorname{reg}} the regular locus of X, by \operatorname{Aut}(X) the group of automorphisms of X, and by \mathbb{K}[X] the algebra of regular functions on X.

Suppose that X is an affine algebraic variety. A derivation \partial of \mathbb{K}[X] is called locally nilpotent (LND for short) if for every f\in\mathbb{K}[X] there is n\in\mathbb{Z}\_{\geq 0} such that \partial^{n}(f)=0.
Every LND \partial on \mathbb{K}[X] defines a \mathbb{G}\_{a}-action on \mathbb{K}[X] via the formula (t,f)\mapsto\exp(t\partial)f (t\in\mathbb{K}, f\in\mathbb{K}[X]) and hence induces a \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroup in \operatorname{Aut}(X). By [Fre, § 1.5] this yields a bijection between LNDs on \mathbb{K}[X] modulo proportionality and \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroups on X. Moreover, if X is equipped with an action of an algebraic group F, then it is easy to see that \partial is F-semiinvariant if and only if the corresponding \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroup is F-normalized (and hence an F-root subgroup).

Below we shall need the following elementary facts.

###### Lemma 1.

Let \partial be an LND on an algebra A over \mathbb{Q} without zero divisors. Let a,b\in A such that ab\in\operatorname{Ker}(\partial), then either a\in\operatorname{Ker}(\partial) or b\in\operatorname{Ker}(\partial).

###### Proof.

Let n,m be the minimal numbers such that \partial^{n+1}(a)=\partial^{m+1}(b)=0. Then by Leibnitz rule we get

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \partial^{n+m}(ab)=\sum\_{k=0}^{n+m}\binom{n+m}{k}\partial^{k}(a)\partial^{n+m-% k}(b)=\binom{n+m}{n}\partial^{n}(a)\partial^{m}(b)=0. |  |

This implies the vanishing of either \partial^{n}(a) or \partial^{m}(b), which contradicts the assumption.
∎

###### Corollary 2.

Let \partial be an LND on an algebra A over \mathbb{Q} and let f\in A be an invertible element. Then f\in\operatorname{Ker}(\partial).

###### Lemma 2.

Let X be an irreducible affine variety, let f\in\mathbb{K}[X], and consider the principal open subset X\_{f}=\{x\in X\mid f(x)\neq 0\}. For every \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroup R on X\_{f} there exists a \mathbb{G}\_{a}-subgroup \widetilde{R} on X that preserves X\_{f} and has on it the same orbits as R.
