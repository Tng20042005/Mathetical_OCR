Consider a nonzero B-semiinvariant function f\in k[X] and let D be its divisor of zeros.
Let P be the stabilizer in G of the line spanned by f.
Then P is a parabolic subgroup in G containing B.
Consider also one more parabolic subgroup P(X)\supset B defined as the stabilizer of a generic B-orbit in X.

Consider the following P-equivariant map:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \psi\colon X\setminus D\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}^{\*},\ x\mapsto l\_{x},\ \text{ % where }\ l\_{x}(\xi)=\frac{\xi f}{f}(x). |  |

Let us recall the version of the local structure theorem obtained by
Knop.

###### Theorem 2 ([Kno, Thm. 2.3, Prop. 2.4]).

For some x\_{0}\in X\setminus D put l:=\psi(x\_{0}), L:=G\_{l}, and Z:=\psi^{-1}(l). Then the following assertions hold.

1. (a)

   The image of \psi is a single P-orbit isomorphic to P\_{u}.
2. (b)

   L is a Levi subgroup of P and there is an isomorphism

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | P\*\_{L}Z\rightarrow X\setminus D\simeq P\_{u}\times Z. |  |
3. (c)

   Assume that P=P(X). Then the kernel L\_{0} of the action of L on Z contains the derived subgroup of L.

From the conjugacy of maximal tori in G it follows that x\_{0} can be chosen so that L\supset T.
In the situation of (c), we see that the torus A=L/L\_{0}=P/(L\_{0}P\_{u}) acts effectively on Z.

To get a relative version of the local structure theorem (see Brion, Luna, Vust [BLV]), let Y be a G-orbit in X, denote by \overline{Y} its closure in X, let D\_{Y}\subset Y be a proper closed B-stable subvariety such that P(Y)=P(Y\setminus D\_{Y}), and let \partial X be a closed G-stable subvariety in X containing \overline{Y}\setminus Y. By Lemma 3 there is a B-semiinvariant function f\in\mathbb{K}[X] vanishing on \partial X\cup D\_{Y} and not vanishing identically on Y. Let D be the divisor of zeros of f, put X\_{f}=X\setminus D and let P be the stabilizer in G of the line spanned by f. We now apply Theorem 2 to f and a point x\_{0}\in Y\setminus D; consider the resulting Levi subgroup L\subset P and the closed L-stable subvariety Z=\psi^{-1}(\psi(x\_{0}))\subset X\_{f}.

###### Theorem 3.

The following assertions hold.

1. (a)

   The variety X\_{f}\simeq P\*\_{L}Z\simeq P\_{u}\times Z is affine.
2. (b)

   The subsets Y\setminus D and Z\_{Y}=Z\cap Y are closed in X\_{f} and Y\setminus D\simeq P\_{u}\times A\times C where A=L/L\_{0} is a torus and C is a closed subvariety in Z on which L\_{0} acts trivially.

###### Corollary 3.

Suppose that Y is spherical. Then Y\setminus D\simeq P\_{u}\times A and Z\_{Y}\simeq A.

###### Corollary 4.

Suppose that X is spherical. Then Z is spherical as an L-variety and Z\_{Y} is the unique closed L-orbit in Z.

###### Proof.

Since X is spherical, it contains an open B-orbit Bz\_{0}. The subset X\_{f}\simeq P\_{u}\times Z being open in X, the point z\_{0} can be taken from Z.
Then the open set Bz\_{0} is isomorphic to P\_{u}\times(Z\cap Bz\_{0}). Using the semidirect product decomposition B=P\_{u}\leftthreetimes B\_{L} (where B\_{L}=B\cap L) we get Z\cap Bz\_{0}\simeq B\_{L}z\_{0}, which is dense in Z.
This implies both claims.
∎

###### Proposition 1.

Let Y be a spherical G-orbit in X^{\operatorname{reg}}, let z\in Z\_{Y} be a point, and let N\_{z} be the normal space to Y at z. Assume that either Z has a unique closed L\_{0}-orbit or \mathbb{K}[N\_{z}]^{L\_{0}}=\mathbb{K}. Then Z\simeq L\*\_{L\_{0}}N\_{z}.
