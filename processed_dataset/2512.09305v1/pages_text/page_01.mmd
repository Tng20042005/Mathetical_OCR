###### Abstract

Estimation of the ordered scale parameter of a two scale mixture of the exponential distribution is considered under Stein loss and symmetric loss. Under certain conditions, we prove that the inadmissibility equivariant estimator exhibits several improved estimators. Consequently, we propose various estimators that dominate the best affine equivariant estimators (BAEE). Also, we propose a class of estimators that dominates BAEE. We have proved that the boundary estimator of this class is a generalized Bayes estimator. The results are applied to the multivariate Lomax distribution and the Exponential Inverse Gaussian (E-IG) distribution. Consequently, we have obtained improved estimators for the ordered scale parameters of two multivariate Lomax distributions and the exponential inverse Gaussian distribution. For each case, we have conducted a simulation study to compare the risk performance of the improved estimators.

## 1 Introduction

The problem of estimating the ordered scale (location) parameter of two or more distributions has been extensively studied in the literature because of its applications in various areas such as medical research, reliability engineering, agricultural studies, economics, etc. Some examples where the ordering of the parameter arises naturally are as follows.

* (i)

  It is natural to assume that the average yield of a certain crop is higher when using fertilizer than when no fertilizer is used.
* (ii)

  It is expected that the waiting time in a ticket counter of a popular railway station is higher than that of an unpopular railway station.
* (iii)

  In reliability engineering, the lifetimes of machine components operate under normal operating conditions typically last longer than those tested operate in high-stress conditions, leading to the natural order restriction on the rate of failure.

For some more examples and a detailed review, we refer to [37] and [40]. We also refer to [30] and [39] for more applications of estimation under order restriction. In the literature, several authors have studied the estimation of location and scale parameters under ordered restrictions for various probability distributions. For some initial work in this direction, we refer to [4], [9], [2], [20], [21], [22] and reference therein. This manuscript will investigate component-wise estimation of the ordered scale parameter of a two-scale mixture of exponential distributions. Let X\_{1},X\_{2},\dots,X\_{n} have the joint density

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | f(x\_{1},x\_{2},\dots,x\_{n};\mu,\sigma)=\int\_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\tau^{n}}{\sigma^% {p\_{1}}}e^{-\frac{\tau}{\sigma}\sum\limits\_{i=1}^{n}(x\_{i}-\mu)}I\_{(\mu,\infty% )}(x\_{(1)})dH(\tau) |  | (1) |

where x\_{(1)}=\min\left\{x\_{1},x\_{2},\dots,x\_{n}\right\}, I\_{(a,b)}(.) is the indicator function and \mu\in\mathbb{R}, \sigma>0 are unknown. The interpretation of
the equation (1) is, given \tau>0, X\_{1},X\_{2},\dots,X\_{n} are i.i.d. exponential random variables with location parameter \mu and scale parameter \sigma/\tau that is Exp(\mu,\sigma/\tau). This model is named a scale mixture of exponential distributions. It was originally introduced by [24] in assessing the reliability of a parallel and series system in terms of their component reliabilities. The authors have argued that the distribution of the lifetimes of n independent components will not be independent when these are working in the same laboratory environment. The common laboratory environment may influence the lifetime of the components. To address this issue, [24]
