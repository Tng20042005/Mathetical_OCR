Let f\_{1}(x) and f\_{2}(x) be the densities supported on the domain set \Omega\_{1} and \Omega\_{2} respectively, where \Omega\_{1}\subset\Omega\_{2} and the ration f\_{1}(x)/f\_{2}(x) is nondecreasing in x\in\Omega\_{1}. If X is a random variable having density f\_{1}(x) or f\_{2}(x) and also a(x), x\in\Omega\_{1}, is nondecreasing (nonincreasing) then E\_{f\_{1}}a(X)\geq(\leq)E\_{f\_{2}}a(X). Moreover, if a(x) and the ration f\_{1}(x)/a\_{2}(x) are strictly monotone, then E\_{f\_{1}}a(X)>(<)E\_{f\_{2}}a(X).

In this paper, estimation of the scale parameter is considered from two mixture model with an unknown scale parameter. In Section 2 of this paper, we used the [38] technique to derive a class of improved estimators of scale parameter \sigma\_{1} under two scale invariant loss functions L\_{1}(\cdot) and L\_{2}(\cdot). Also we have derive a class of estimators improving upon the BAEE by using the [19] IERD approach. In Section 3 the estimation of the parameter \sigma\_{2} is considered. Here we have used the [19] IERD approach to find derive a class of improved estimators of \sigma\_{2} under two scale invariant loss function L\_{1}(\cdot) and L\_{2}(\cdot) respectively. Moreover we have obtain a double shrinkage estimator of the scale parameter \sigma\_{2} by using the technique of [15] under the loss function L\_{1}(\cdot) and L\_{2}(\cdot). As an application, the results obtained in Section 2, 3, are used to derive the improved estimators for scale mixture of exponential distributions and in particular for multivariate Lomax distribution (see in Subsection 4.1) and Exponential-Inverse Gaussian (E-IG) distribution (see Subsection 4.3). These are all presented in Section 4.

## 2 Improved estimation for \sigma\_{1} when \sigma\_{1}\leq\sigma\_{2}

This section will consider the improved estimation of \sigma\_{1} when \sigma\_{1}\leq\sigma\_{2}. To use the constraints \sigma\_{1}\leq\sigma\_{2}, we utilize the second sample and consider a class of estimators of the form

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{D}\_{1}=\left\{\delta\_{\varphi\_{1}}=\varphi\_{1}\left(W\right)S\_{1};\ % \ W=\frac{S\_{2}}{S\_{1}},\ \mbox{$\varphi\_{1}(.)$ is a positive function}\right\} |  | (3) |

We can observe that the BAEE lies in this class. In the next theorem, we find an improved estimator that dominates the \delta\_{\varphi\_{1}}. As an application of this theorem, we derive an estimator that dominates the BAEE \delta\_{j1} for j=1,2

###### Theorem 1.

1. (i)

   Under symmetric loss function L\_{1}(\cdot), the risk of the estimator

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \delta^{1}\_{1S1}(X,S)=\min\left\{\varphi\_{1}(W),\varphi\_{11}(W)\right\}S\_{1}, |  |

   is nowhere larger than that of the estimator \delta\_{\varphi\_{1}} provided P\left(\varphi\_{11}(W)<\varphi\_{1}(W)\right)>0, where \varphi\_{11}(W)=\frac{(1+W)\sqrt{E(\tau)}}{\sqrt{(p\_{1}+p\_{2}-2)(p\_{1}+p\_{2}-3%
   )E(1/\tau)}}.
2. (ii)

   For the Stein loss function L\_{2}(\cdot), the risk of the estimator

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \delta^{2}\_{1S1}(X,S)=\min\left\{\varphi\_{1}(W),\varphi\_{12}(W)\right\}S\_{1}, |  |

   is nowhere larger than that of the estimator \delta\_{\varphi\_{1}} provided P\left(\varphi\_{12}(W)<\varphi\_{1}(W)\right)>0, where \varphi\_{12}(W)=\frac{(1+W)}{(p\_{1}+p\_{2}-2)E(\frac{1}{\tau})}.

Proof: (i) We can easily seen that the risk function of the estimator of the form (3) depend on the unknown parameter through \eta=\frac{\sigma\_{1}}{\sigma\_{2}}\leq 1 and it can be written as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle R(\delta\_{\varphi\_{1}};\eta) | \displaystyle=E\left\{E\left[(\varphi\_{1}(W)S\_{1}/\sigma\_{1})+\frac{1}{(% \varphi\_{1}(W)S\_{1}/\sigma\_{1})}-2\bigg{|}W\right]\right\} |  |

The inner conditional risk is minimized at

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi\_{1}(w;\eta)=\left(\frac{E\left(1/V\_{1}|W=w\right)}{E\left(V\_{1}|W=w% \right)}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}. |  | (4) |

We can observe that the conditional distribution of V\_{1}=\frac{S\_{1}}{\sigma\_{1}}, given W=w>0 and T=\tau>0 is proportional to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | v\_{1}^{p\_{1}+p\_{2}-3}e^{-\tau v\_{1}(1+w\eta)}\tau^{p\_{1}+p\_{2}-2},\ w>0,\ v\_{1% }>0, |  |

and we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \varphi\_{1}(w;\eta)=\left(\frac{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\int\_{0}^{\infty}v\_{1}^{p\_{1}% +p\_{2}-4}e^{-\tau v\_{1}(1+w\eta)}\tau^{p\_{1}+p\_{2}-2}dv\_{1}dH(\tau)}{\int\_{0}^% {\infty}\int\_{0}^{\infty}v\_{1}^{p\_{1}+p\_{2}-2}e^{-\tau v\_{1}(1+w\eta)}\tau^{p\_% {1}+p\_{2}-2}dv\_{1}dH(\tau)}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} |  |

Using the transformation z\_{1}=\tau v\_{1}(1+w\eta), we obtain equation (2) in the following form,
