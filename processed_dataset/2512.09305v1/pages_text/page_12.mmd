|  | \delta\_{2B}^{1}=\left(\frac{E\left(\sigma\_{1}\big{|}X,S\_{1},Y,S\_{2}\right)}{E% \left(\frac{1}{\sigma\_{1}}\big{|}X,S\_{1},Y,S\_{2}\right)}\right)^{1/2}, |  |

where the expectation are taken with respect to the posterior distribution specified in the equation (18). After some calculation, it is found that the generalized Bayes estimator coincides with the estimator \delta\_{\psi\_{\*}^{1}}.

###### Remark 12.

In the case when \tau=1 with probability one, then the Theorem 7 reduces to the following result which was previously derived by [29] in Corollary 3.8 and Corollary 3.9 for entropy and symmetric loss functions respectively.

###### Remark 13.

By using a similar argument, we can prove that the generalized Bayes estimator of \sigma\_{2} under the loss function L\_{2}(\cdot), with respect to the same prior distribution \pi(\sigma\_{1},\sigma\_{2},\mu\_{1},\mu\_{2}), also coincides with the \delta\_{\psi\_{\*}^{2}} .

Now we derive an improved estimators for \sigma\_{2}, from a class of estimators where we use the statistic S\_{2} and Y. The class of estimators is considered as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathcal{C}\_{2}=\left\{\delta\_{\psi\_{2}}=\psi\_{2}\left(U\_{1}\right)S\_{2};\ U\_{% 1}=\frac{Y}{S\_{2}},\ \mbox{$\psi\_{2}(.)$ is a positive function}\right\} |  | (19) |

###### Theorem 8.

1. (i)

   Under the L\_{1}(\cdot) loss function, the risk of the estimator

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \delta\_{\psi\_{21}}^{1}=\begin{cases}\min\left\{\psi\_{2}(U\_{1}),\psi\_{21}(U\_{1}% )\right\}S\_{2},&\ U\_{1}>0\\ \psi\_{2}(U\_{1})S\_{2},&\text{otherwise}\end{cases} |  | (20) |

   is nowhere larger than that of the estimator \delta\_{\psi\_{2}} provide P(\psi\_{2}(U\_{1}) >\psi\_{21}(U\_{1}))>0, where

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \psi\_{21}(U\_{1})=\frac{(1+p\_{2}U\_{1})}{\sqrt{p\_{2}(p\_{2}-1)}}\min\Bigg{\{}% \left(\frac{E(\tau^{p\_{2}+2})}{E(\tau^{p\_{2}})}\right)^{1/2},\left(\frac{E(% \tau)}{E(\tau^{-1})}\right)^{1/2}\Bigg{\}}. |  |
2. (ii)

   Under the loss function L\_{2}(\cdot), the risk of the estimator

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \delta\_{\psi\_{22}}^{2}=\begin{cases}\min\left\{\psi\_{2}(U\_{1}),\psi\_{22}(U\_{1}% )\right\}S\_{2},&U\_{1}>0,\\ \psi\_{2}(U\_{1})S\_{2},&\text{otherwise}\end{cases} |  |

   is nowhere larger than that of \delta\_{\psi\_{2}}, provided P(\psi\_{2}(U\_{1})>\psi\_{22}(U\_{1}))>0, where \psi\_{22}(U\_{1})=\frac{(1+p\_{2}U\_{1})}{p\_{2}E(\frac{1}{\tau})}.

Proof.

1. (i)

   Under the loss function L\_{1}(\cdot), the risk of the estimator \delta\_{\psi\_{2}}(U\_{1}) can be expressed as

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \displaystyle R(\delta\_{\psi\_{2}};\mu\_{2},\sigma\_{2})=E^{U\_{1}}E\left[\left(% \psi\_{2}(U\_{1})V\_{2}+\frac{1}{\psi\_{2}(U\_{1})V\_{2}}-2\right)\bigg{|}\ U\_{1}\right] |  |

   For a given \tau>0, the conditional density of V\_{2} given U\_{1}=u\_{1} is obtain as

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | f\_{\rho\_{2}}(v\_{2}|u\_{1})=\frac{p\_{2}}{\Gamma(p\_{2}-1)}v\_{2}^{p\_{2}-1}e^{-\tau v% \_{2}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\tau^{p\_{2}},\ v\_{2}>\max\left\{0,% \frac{\rho\_{2}}{u\_{1}}\right\},\ u\_{1}\in\mathbb{R} |  |

   where \rho\_{2}=\frac{\mu\_{2}}{\sigma\_{2}}\in\mathbb{R}. It can be easily seen that the conditional risk function
