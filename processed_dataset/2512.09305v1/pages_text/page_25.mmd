   |  | \delta\_{22}^{2}=\begin{cases}\min\left\{\psi\_{22}(U\_{1}),d\_{2}\right\}S\_{2},&% \ U\_{1}>0\\ d\_{2}S\_{2},&\text{otherwise}\end{cases} |  |

We now obtain improved estimator of \sigma\_{2} with in the class of estimator (17) using the [19].

###### Theorem 20.

1. (i)

   Under the loss function L\_{1}(\cdot), the risk of the estimator \delta\_{\psi\_{1}} is nowhere larger than that of \delta\_{12} provided the function \psi\_{1}(u) satisfies the following conditions

   1. (a)

      \psi\_{1}(u) is non-decreasing in u and \lim\limits\_{u\rightarrow 0}\psi\_{1}(u)=\left(\frac{m}{(p\_{2}-1)(p\_{2}-2)(1/m+%
      1/n)}\right)^{1/2}
   2. (b)

      \psi\_{1}(u)\leq\psi\_{\*}^{1}(u)=\left(\frac{m\left[\frac{B(p\_{1}-1,p\_{2}-2)}{%
      \Gamma(p\_{1}-1)}-B\left(\frac{u}{1+u};\ p\_{1}-1,p\_{2}-2\right)\right]}{(1/m+1/%
      n)(p\_{1}+p\_{2}-2)(p\_{1}+p\_{2}-3)\left[\frac{B(p\_{1}-1,p\_{2})}{\Gamma(p\_{1}-1)}%
      -B\left(\frac{u}{1+u};\ p\_{1}-1,p\_{2}\right)\right]}\right)^{1/2}.
2. (ii)

   Let us assume that the function \psi\_{1}(u) satisfies the following conditions

   1. (a)

      \psi\_{1}(u) is non-decreasing in u and \lim\limits\_{u\rightarrow 0}\psi\_{1}(u)=\frac{1}{(p\_{2}-1)(1/m+1/n)}
   2. (b)

      \psi\_{1}(u)\leq\psi\_{\*}^{2}(u)=\frac{\frac{B(p\_{1}-1,p\_{2}-1)}{\Gamma(p\_{1}-1)%
      }-B\left(\frac{u}{1+u};\ p\_{1}-1,p\_{2}-1\right)}{(1/m+1/n)(p\_{1}+p\_{2}-2)\left%
      [\frac{B(p\_{1}-1,p\_{2})}{\Gamma(p\_{1}-1)}-B\left(\frac{u}{1+u};\ p\_{1},p\_{2}-1%
      \right)\right]}.

   Then the risk of the estimator \delta\_{\psi\_{1}} defined in (17) is nowhere larger than that of \delta\_{22}.

As an application of the Theorem 9, we have obtain the following results

###### Theorem 21.

1. (i)

   Under the loss function L\_{1}(\cdot), we consider the estimator

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \delta\_{D1}=\left(\psi\_{11}(U)+\psi\_{21}(U\_{1})-c\_{2}\right)S\_{2} |  |

   where \psi\_{11} and \psi\_{21} are defined in Theorem 13, and c\_{2}=\left(\frac{m}{(p\_{2}-1)(p\_{2}-2)(1/m+1/n)}\right)^{1/2}. Then the estimator \delta\_{D1} has smaller or equal risk function than that of the estimator \delta\_{\psi\_{11}}, \delta\_{\psi\_{21}} and so of the estimator \delta\_{12}=c\_{2}S\_{2}.
2. (ii)

   The estimator

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \delta\_{D2}=\left(\psi\_{21}(U)+\psi\_{22}(U\_{1})-d\_{2}\right)S\_{2} |  |

   has the smaller risk than that of the estimator \delta\_{\psi\_{21}}, \delta\_{\psi\_{22}} and so of the estimator \delta\_{22}=d\_{2}S\_{2} under the loss function L\_{2}(\cdot).

### 4.4 Simulation study

In this Subsection, we have discuss the numerical performance of the proposed estimators derived in Sections 4.3. For this purpose, we generate the mixing distribution from an inverse Gaussian distribution IG(m,n) with parameter values (m,n)=(3,5),(4,6),(8,10). The performance of the improved estimators is calculated using the relative risk improvement (RRI) with respect to the BAEE. The RRI is computed in the same manner as defined in the Subsection 4.2. In this numerical study, we consider the discussion for risk performance of \sigma\_{1} and \sigma\_{2} for E-IG distribution under the loss function L\_{2}(\cdot). In Table G1-G5, we have presented the RRI values of \delta\_{12}^{2} \delta\_{13}^{2}, and \delta\_{14}^{2} with the respect to the BAEE \delta\_{21}. From the tabulated RRi values we have observed that the RRI of \delta\_{12}^{2}, \delta\_{13}^{2} and \delta\_{14}^{2} increasing function of \eta for 0<\eta\leq 1. Also the RRI of \delta\_{12}^{2}, \delta\_{13}^{2} and \delta\_{14}^{2} decrease as (m,n) increases.
In Table G5, we have tabulated the RRI of \delta\_{11}^{2} and \delta\_{\varphi\_{\*}^{2}}. It can be easily seen that the risk of these estimators are independent of the parameter \mu\_{1} and \mu\_{2}. Thus we have computed the RRI of \delta\_{11}^{2} and \delta\_{\varphi\_{\*}^{2}} only at (\mu\_{1},\mu\_{2})=(0,0). Here the \delta\_{11}^{2} and \delta\_{\varphi\_{\*}^{2}} are decreasing function of (m,n). RRI of \delta\_{11}^{2} is an increasing function \eta but RRI of \delta\_{\varphi\_{\*}^{2}} is not monotone function of \eta, it is increasing when \eta<0.6 (approximately) and decreases for \eta>0.6 (approximately). Overall, Table G5 shows that \delta\_{\varphi\_{\*}^{2}} performs better than \delta\_{11}^{2} when 0<\eta<0.6 (approximately) and when \eta>0.6 (approximately) then \delta\_{11}^{2} performs better than \delta\_{\varphi\_{\*}^{2}}.
Among the estimators in Table G1-G4, we observed that the best performance of the estimator varies with the values of (\mu\_{1},\mu\_{2}). Specifically:
