## 5 Concluding remarks

In this work, we are tried to investigate the problem of estimating the scale parameters \sigma\_{1} and \sigma\_{2} from two scale mixture of exponential distribution under two scale invariant loss function L\_{1}(\cdot) and L\_{2}(\cdot). We begin by deriving results for the scenario in which the mixing parameter \tau is unknown. As an application of derived theory, we then obtain two application based on multivariate Lomax distribution and E-IG distribution. We consider a class of scale invariant estimators and proposed sufficient conditions under which we obtain estimators that dominate the BAEE. Furthermore, we derive several [38]-type estimators that utilize all the information contained in the samples from the two populations and show that they dominate the BAEE. It has been observed that that a generalized Bayes estimator coincides with the [7]-type estimator. To utilize the additional information available from both samples, we construct a double-shrinkage estimator for \sigma\_{2} as presented in Theorem 9. A numerical study has been conducted to compare the risk performance of these estimators.
