   |  | R\_{2}(\delta\_{\psi\_{2}},\rho\_{2})=E\left[\left(\psi\_{2}(U\_{1})V\_{2}+\frac{1}{% \psi\_{2}(U\_{1})V\_{2}}-2\right)\bigg{|}\ U\_{1}=u\_{1}\right] |  |

   is minimized at

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2})=\left(\frac{E\left[1/V\_{2}\big{|}\ U\_{1}=u\_{1}\right]% }{E\left[V\_{2}\big{|}\ U\_{1}=u\_{1}\right]}\right)^{1/2} |  |

   Now we will consider two cases. First case, we consider \mu\_{2}>0, u\_{2}>0. In this case we have

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2})=\left(\frac{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\int\_{\frac{\rho\_{2}}{u\_% {1}}}^{\infty}v\_{2}^{p\_{2}-2}e^{-\tau v\_{2}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau% }\tau^{p\_{2}}dv\_{2}dH(\tau)}{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\int\_{\frac{\rho\_{2}}{u\_{1}}}^{% \infty}v\_{2}^{p\_{2}}e^{-\tau v\_{2}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\tau^{p\_% {2}}dv\_{2}dH(\tau)}\right)^{1/2} |  | (21) |

   Using the transformation z\_{4}=\tau v\_{2}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1}), we obtain the equation (21) as follows,

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \displaystyle\psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2})= | \displaystyle(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})\left(\frac{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\tau e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}% \tau}\int\_{\xi\_{\*}}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}-2}e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}dH(\tau)}{\int\_{0}^% {\infty}\frac{1}{\tau}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\int\_{\xi\_{\*}}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}% }e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}dH(\tau)}\right)^{1/2} |  |

   Now for a given \tau>0, we can easily seen that

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \frac{\int\_{\xi\_{\*}}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}-2}e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}}{\int\_{\xi\_{\*}}^{% \infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}}e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}}=E\_{\xi\_{\*}}(Z\_{4}^{-2}), |  |

   where Z\_{4} has density g\_{2}(z\_{4},\xi\_{\*})\propto z\_{4}^{p\_{2}}e^{-z\_{4}}I\_{(\xi\_{\*},\infty)}(z\_{4}) with \xi\_{\*}=\frac{\tau\rho\_{2}}{u\_{1}}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1}). For \xi\_{\*}>0, \frac{g\_{2}(z\_{4},\xi\_{\*})}{g\_{2}(z\_{4},0)} is non-decreasing then we have E\_{\xi\_{\*}}\left(Z\_{4}^{-2}\right)\leq E\_{0}\left(Z\_{4}^{-2}\right)=\frac{1}{p%
   \_{2}(p\_{2}-1)} and hence \int\_{\xi\_{\*}}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}-2}e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}\leq\frac{1}{p\_{2}(p\_{2}%
   -1)}\int\_{\xi\_{\*}}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}}e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}. Finally we have
