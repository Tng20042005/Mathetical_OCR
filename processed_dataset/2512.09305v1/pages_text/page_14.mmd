   |  | \displaystyle\psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2}) | \displaystyle\leq\frac{(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})}{\sqrt{p\_{2}(p\_{2}-1)}}\left(\frac{\int\_% {0}^{\infty}\tau e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\int\_{\xi\_{\*}}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}}e^{-% z\_{4}}dz\_{4}dH(\tau)}{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\tau}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\int% \_{\xi\_{\*}}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}}e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}dH(\tau)}\right)^{1/2} |  |

   Again we take a transformation z\_{4}=\tau x\_{4} then we have

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \begin{split}\psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2})&\leq\frac{(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})}{\sqrt{p\_{2}(p\_% {2}-1)}}\left(\frac{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\int\_{\xi\_{\*\*}}^{\infty}x\_{4}^{p\_{2}}\tau% ^{p\_{2}+2}e^{-(x-p\_{2}\rho)\tau}dx\_{4}dH(\tau)}{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\int\_{\xi\_{\*\*% }}^{\infty}x\_{4}^{p\_{2}}\tau^{p\_{2}}e^{-(x\_{4}-p\_{2}\rho)\tau}dx\_{4}dH(\tau)}% \right)^{1/2}\end{split} |  | (22) |

   where, \xi\_{\*\*}=\frac{\rho\_{2}}{u\_{1}}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1}). Now for l=x\_{4}-p\_{2}\rho>0, we obtain

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \displaystyle\frac{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\tau^{p\_{2}+2}e^{-l\tau}dH(\tau)}{\int\_{0}% ^{\infty}\tau^{p\_{2}}e^{-l\tau}dH(\tau)}=\int\_{0}^{\infty}\tau^{2}f\_{l}(\tau)% dH(\tau) |  |

   where f\_{l}(\tau)\propto\tau^{p\_{2}}e^{-l\tau}. But, \frac{f\_{l}(\tau)}{f\_{0}(\tau)} is decreasing in \tau, so by using Lemma (2) we have,

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \displaystyle\int\_{0}^{\infty}\tau^{2}f\_{l}(\tau)dH(\tau)\leq\int\_{0}^{\infty}% \tau^{2}f\_{0}(\tau)dH(\tau)=\frac{E(\tau^{p\_{2}+2})}{E(\tau^{p\_{2}})} |  | (23) |

   From (22) and (23) we get

   |  |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \displaystyle\psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2}) | \displaystyle\leq\frac{(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})}{\sqrt{p\_{2}(p\_{2}-1)}}\left(\frac{E(% \tau^{p\_{2}+2})}{E(\tau^{p\_{2}})}\right)^{1/2} |  | (24) |

   Now we consider the second case where, \mu\_{2}\leq 0 and u\_{1}>0. In this case we have,

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2})=\left(\frac{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\int\_{0}^{\infty}v\_{2}^{% p\_{2}-2}e^{-\tau v\_{2}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\tau^{p\_{2}}dv\_{2}dH% (\tau)}{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\int\_{0}^{\infty}v\_{2}^{p\_{2}}e^{-\tau v\_{2}(1+p\_{2}u% \_{1})}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\tau^{p\_{2}}dv\_{2}dH(\tau)}\right)^{1/2} |  |

   Using the transformation z\_{4}=\tau v\_{2}(1+p\_{2}u\_{1}), we have

   |  |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \displaystyle\psi\_{2}(u\_{1};\rho\_{2})= | \displaystyle(1+p\_{2}u\_{1})\left(\frac{\int\_{0}^{\infty}\tau e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}% \tau}\int\_{0}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}-2}e^{-z\_{4}}dz\_{4}dH(\tau)}{\int\_{0}^{% \infty}\frac{1}{\tau}e^{p\_{2}\rho\_{2}\tau}\int\_{0}^{\infty}z\_{4}^{p\_{2}}e^{-z\_% {4}}dz\_{4}dH(\tau)}\right)^{1/2} |  |
