Markov operators acting fiberwise with respect to a Haar system. A measured groupoid equipped with such an invariant Markov operator is called *fiberwise Liouville* if almost all fiberwise actions admit no non-trivial bounded harmonic functions. A strengthened version of this notion, adapting the classical Choquet–Deny property to the discrete measured groupoid setting, was developed in [Berendschot2024]. Kaimanovich showed that a measured groupoid which admits an invariant fiberwise Liouville Markov operator is amenable and conjectured that the reverse implication should hold as well, which was confirmed by Chu and Li in [Li2018] (see also [BuKa21]). This yields a groupoid analog of the characterization of amenability of groups in terms of bounded harmonic functions, proven in one direction and conjectured by Furstenberg [Furstenberg73] and proven in the other direction independently by Kaimanovich–Vershik [VershikKaimanovich79, KaimanovichVershik83] and Rosenblatt [Ros81].

Analogs of Kesten’s criterion have been formulated in a variety of contexts, including invariant random subgroups [AGV14], group extensions of topological Markov chains [Stadlbauer2013], and quantum groups [Banica1999]. Building on Kaimanovich’s framework of invariant Markov operators on groupoids, the goal of this article is to establish an analog of Kesten’s criterion in the setting of discrete probability measure-preserving measured groupoids. To this end, denote by P^{\pi} the Markov operator associated with a Borel field of probability measures \pi (see Subsection 3.1). We introduce the following definition.

###### Definition A (see Definition 3.5).

Let (\mathcal{G},\mu) be a discrete probability measure-preserving groupoid. We say that (\mathcal{G},\mu) satisfies *Kesten’s criterion* if, for every symmetric Borel field of probability measures \pi, the restriction of the Markov operator P^{\pi} to any invariant Borel subset E\subseteq\mathcal{G}^{(0)} with \mu(E)>0 has operator norm equal to 1.

Whereas the original Kesten’s criterion stated above shows that for groups it suffices that a single Markov operator associated with a symmetric non-degenerate measure has norm one in order to deduce amenability, this is no longer true for general measured groupoids, as observed in [Kai01]. Instead, we obtain the following characterization, whose proof relies on Hayes’ approach in [Ha24] (see also [AFH24]).

###### Theorem B.

Let (\mathcal{G},\mu) be a discrete probability measure-preserving groupoid. Then (\mathcal{G},\mu) is amenable if and only if it satisfies Kesten’s criterion.

Our theorem fits into the broader program of finding connections between probability theory and the study of measured equivalence relations and measured groupoids. In that same program, one finds the already mentioned works of Kaimanovich [Kai01, Ka05], Hayes [Ha24], and Abert, Fraczyk and Hayes [AFH24]. These works make explicit use of equivalence relations. Note, however, that the study of random unimodular random graphs, trees, or surfaces requires the study of (often covertly defined) particular measured equivalence relations (see [AlLy07, AbBi22, AFH25]). These objects arise naturally in the study of percolation theory [BeLySc15].

We also deduce the following interpretation of the norm of P^{\pi} associated with a symmetric Borel field of probability measures \pi, and hence of the amenability of the ambient groupoid. In particular, we provide a formula involving averages of return probabilities (see Remark 3.9), which recovers part of Kesten’s original inspiration.

###### Theorem C.

Let (\mathcal{G},\mu) be a discrete probability measure-preserving groupoid, and let \pi be a symmetric Borel field of probability measures on \mathcal{G}. Then the *E-spectral radius* of \pi,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \rho\_{E}(\mathcal{G},\mu):=\lim\_{n\to\infty}\left(\mu(E)^{-1}\left\langle(P^{% \pi})^{2n}\chi\_{E},\chi\_{E}\right\rangle\right)^{\frac{1}{2n}}\,, |  |

exists and satisfies \rho\_{E}(\mathcal{G},\pi)\leq 1 for every Borel subset E\subseteq\mathcal{G}^{(0)} with \mu(E)>0. Moreover, \rho\_{\mathcal{G}^{(0)}}(\mathcal{G},\pi)=\|P^{\pi}\|.
