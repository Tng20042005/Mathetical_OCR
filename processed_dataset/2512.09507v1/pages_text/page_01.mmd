###### Abstract.

Inspired by Kesten’s criterion for the amenability of groups, we establish a characterization of the amenability of discrete probability measure-preserving groupoids in terms of the operator norms of symmetric invariant Markov operators.

## 1. Introduction

Amenability of groups, introduced by von Neumann in [Neumann1929], is one of the central notions in modern group theory, probability theory, ergodic theory, and functional analysis. A group is called *amenable* if it possesses an invariant mean. This concept admits numerous equivalent characterizations; for instance, via the existence of *Følner sequences* (see [Folner1955]), the *nuclearity* of the group’s reduced group C{}^{\ast}-algebra (see [Lance1973]), the existence of approximately invariant sequences of probability measures (see [Reiter1968]), or the existence of fixed points for continuous affine actions on compact convex subsets of locally convex topological vector spaces (see [Day1956]). For further characterizations, see [Pier1984].

In his seminal work [Kesten1959a] (see also [Kesten1959b]), Kesten studied random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups and obtained yet another characterization of amenability, relating it to the decay of return probabilities to the identity. More precisely, if the support of a given random walk generates the group, then the probability of returning to the identity in 2n steps decays exponentially if and only if the group is non-amenable.

Kesten’s criterion has been proven useful in several contexts, see e.g. [Kesten1959b, KaimanovichVershik83, Ol05, ST10, BV25]. It can be formulated naturally in terms of the spectral radius of the Markov operator associated with the random walk, in a way that we explicitly cite now.

###### Theorem (Kesten’s criterion [Kesten1959a]).

Let G be a countable discrete group, let \mu be a symmetric probability measure on G whose support generates G, and let P\_{\mu} be the associated Markov operator on \ell^{2}(G) defined by (P\_{\mu}\xi)(g):=\sum\_{h\in G}\xi(gh)\,\mu(h) for \xi\in\ell^{2}(G), g\in G. Then G is amenable if and only if the spectral radius of P\_{\mu} is equal to 1.

Over time, amenability has found natural extensions in many other areas of mathematics. In particular, Zimmer introduced an analog for discrete group actions and countable measured equivalence relations in [Zimmer1977a, Zimmer1977b, Zimmer1978] in the late seventies; soon after, Renault extended the notion to general measured groupoids [Renault1980] (see also [Anantharaman-DelarocheRenault2000, Corlette2004]).

As in the case of groups, Renault’s amenability for measured groupoids admits several equivalent formulations (see, e.g., [Anantharaman-DelarocheRenault2000]). In [Ka05], Kaimanovich introduced the *fiberwise Liouville property* for measured groupoids, formulated in terms of invariant
