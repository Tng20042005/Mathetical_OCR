To show the reverse inequality, let (\xi\_{n})\_{n\in\mathbb{N}} be sequence of Borel functions as in Proposition 3.4, and for each n let \xi\_{n}^{E}\in L^{2}(\mathcal{G}|\_{E},(\mu\_{E})\_{t}) be the restriction of \xi\_{n} to \mathcal{G}|\_{E}. Then,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle\langle P\_{E}^{\pi}\xi\_{n}^{E},\xi\_{n}^{E}\rangle | \displaystyle=\frac{1}{\mu(E)}\int\_{E}\sum\_{g\in\mathcal{G}\_{x}}(P\_{E}^{\pi}% \xi\_{n}^{E})(g)\overline{\xi\_{n}^{E}(g)}d\mu(x) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\frac{1}{\mu(E)}\int\_{E}\sum\_{g\in\mathcal{G}\_{x}}\sum\_{h\in% \mathcal{G}^{x}}\xi\_{n}(gh)\overline{\xi\_{n}(g)}\pi(h)d\mu(x) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\frac{1}{\mu(E)}\int\_{E}\sum\_{h\in\mathcal{G}^{x}}\pi(h)\sum\_{g% \in\mathcal{G}\_{x}}\xi\_{n}(gh)\overline{\xi\_{n}(g)}d\mu(x) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\rightarrow\frac{1}{\mu(E)}\int\_{E}\sum\_{h\in\mathcal{G}^{x}}\pi(% h)d\mu(x) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=1\,. |  |

Hence \|P\_{E}^{\pi}\|=1, completing the proof.

###### Remark 3.7.

For groups, it suffices that one Markov operator associated with a symmetric non-degenerate measure has norm 1 in order to conclude amenability. As shown by the examples in [Kai01], this is no longer true at the level of general groupoids. However, for a measurable bundle of groups such a reduction still works. Indeed, if a Markov operator P has norm 1, there exists a sequence (\xi\_{n})\_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq L^{2}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t}) of positive unit vectors such that \langle P\xi\_{n},\xi\_{n}\rangle\to 1. A computation analogous to that in the proof of the “only if” direction of Theorem B shows that the \xi\_{n} are asymptotically invariant. Moreover, the \xi\_{n} may be chosen so that the sum over the target fibres equals 1. Since in a bundle of groups the source and target fibres coincide, Proposition 3.4 then implies that the bundle is amenable.

### 3.4. A formula for the spectral radius

In [Kesten1959a, Kesten1959b], Kesten characterized the amenability of finitely generated groups in terms of the return probabilities of random walks on their Cayley graphs. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce the following notion.

###### Definition 3.8.

Let (\mathcal{G},\mu) be a discrete p.m.p. groupoid. Given a Borel subset E\subseteq\mathcal{G}^{(0)} with \mu(E)>0 and a symmetric Borel field of probability measures \pi:\mathcal{G}\rightarrow[0,\infty), we define
