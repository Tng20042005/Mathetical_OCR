and x\gamma with the unique elements they contain. With this convention, for any Borel subset E\subseteq\mathcal{G}^{(0)} with \mu(E)>0 we obtain a unitary representation \alpha\_{E}:[\mathcal{G}]\longrightarrow\mathcal{U}\big{(}L^{2}(\mathcal{G}|\_{E%
},\mu\_{E})\big{)} via

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (\alpha\_{E}(\gamma)\xi)(g):=\xi(g\gamma)\;\text{ for }\xi\in L^{2}(\mathcal{G}% |\_{E},\mu\_{E}),\gamma\in[\mathcal{G}],g\in\mathcal{G}|\_{E}\,, |  |

where the *restriction* \mathcal{G}|\_{E} of \mathcal{G} to E is the discrete p.m.p. groupoid obtained by equipping \mathcal{G}\_{E}^{E} with the normalized measure \mu\_{E}:=\mu(E)^{-1}\mu|\_{E}. This construction is a special case of the representation introduced in Subsection 2.3. Indeed, one easily checks that [\mathcal{G}] acts on \mathcal{G}|\_{E} by right multiplication in a measure-preserving way.
When E=\mathcal{G}^{(0)}, we omit the index and simply write \alpha=\alpha\_{\mathcal{G}^{(0)}}.

## 3. Main results

In this section we introduce invariant Markov operators on groupoids and establish our main results, Theorem B and Theorem C. Throughout, the pair (\mathcal{G},\mu) will always denote a discrete p.m.p. groupoid.

### 3.1. Invariant Markov operators on groupoids

Let (\mathcal{G},\mu) be a discrete p.m.p. groupoid and let \pi:\mathcal{G}\rightarrow\mathbb{C} be a Borel function. We call \pi *symmetric* if \pi(g^{-1})=\overline{\pi(g)} for \mu\_{t}-almost every g\in\mathcal{G}. Moreover, \pi is called a (Borel) *field of probability measures* if \pi(g)\geq 0 for \mu\_{t}-almost every g\in\mathcal{G} and \sum\_{g\in\mathcal{G}^{x}}\pi(g)=1 for \mu-almost every x\in\mathcal{G}^{(0)}.

Following Hahn [Ha78], the *I-norm* of a Borel function \pi:\mathcal{G}\to\mathbb{C} is defined by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|\pi\|\_{I}=\max\Big{\{}\operatorname\*{ess\,sup}\_{x\in\mathcal{G}^{(0)}}\sum\_{% g\in\mathcal{G}\_{x}}|\pi(g)|,\;\operatorname\*{ess\,sup}\_{x\in\mathcal{G}^{(0)}% }\sum\_{g\in\mathcal{G}^{x}}|\pi(g)|\Big{\}}\,. |  |

If \pi is symmetric, then \|\pi\|\_{I}=\operatorname\*{ess\,sup}\_{x\in\mathcal{G}^{(0)}}\sum\_{g\in\mathcal%
{G}^{x}}|\pi(g)|, so in particular every symmetric field of probability measures has I-norm equal to 1.

Whenever \pi has finite I-norm, it induces for each p\in[1,\infty] a bounded operator P^{\pi}\_{p}\in\mathbb{B}(L^{p}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t})), as established in the following lemma. As before, we usually omit the index p and write P^{\pi}=P^{\pi}\_{p}. For p=2, the operator P^{\pi} will be referred to as the *invariant Markov operator* associated with \pi. Note that Kaimanovich focuses his work on the case p=\infty [Ka05].

###### Lemma 3.1.

Let (\mathcal{G},\mu) be a discrete p.m.p. groupoid, let p\in[1,\infty], and let \pi:\mathcal{G}\rightarrow\mathbb{C} be a Borel function with \|\pi\|\_{I}<\infty. Then the map P^{\pi}:L^{p}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t})\rightarrow L^{p}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t}) given by P^{\pi}(\xi)(g):=\sum\_{h\in\mathcal{G}^{s(g)}}\xi(gh)\,\pi(h) for every \xi\in L^{p}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t}) and \mu\_{t}-almost every g\in\mathcal{G}, is well-defined and defines an element of \mathbb{B}(L^{p}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t})) with operator norm at most \|\pi\|\_{I}.
