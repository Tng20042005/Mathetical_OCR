The purpose of this appendix is to illustrate how Borel fields of probability measures with infinite I-norm can give rise to unbounded Markov operators. We have two examples. The first one occurs in a discrete probability measure-preserving non-ergodic groupoid, whereas the second one occurs in a measure-preserving discrete ergodic groupoid.

### 4.1. First example

We begin by recalling that any countable Borel equivalence relation gives rise to a discrete p.m.p. groupoid. More precisely, let (X,\mu) be a standard probability space, and let \mathcal{R}\subseteq X\times X be a countable Borel equivalence relation. Then \mathcal{R} becomes a discrete measured groupoid with unit space \mathcal{R}^{(0)}:={\sf Diag}(X)\cong X and structure maps

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | s(x,y):=(y,y)\,,\qquad t(x,y):=(x,x)\,,\qquad(x,y)(y,z):=(x,z)\,,\qquad(x,y)^{% -1}:=(y,x) |  |

for all (x,y),(y,z)\in\mathcal{R}. We say that \mathcal{R} is *probability measure-preserving* (*p.m.p.*) if the resulting groupoid is p.m.p.

If X is countable and \mathcal{R}=X\times X is the full equivalence relation, then a Borel system of probability measures reduces to a function \pi\colon\mathcal{R}\to[0,\infty) such that \sum\_{x\in X}\pi(x,y)=1 for every y\in X. The associated Markov operator satisfies

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | P^{\pi}(\xi)(x,y)=\sum\_{z\in X}\xi\big{(}(x,y)(y,z)\big{)}\pi(y,z)=\sum\_{z\in X% }\xi(x,z)\pi(y,z)\,, |  |

for every \xi\in L^{2}(\mathcal{R},\mu\_{t}); hence P^{\pi} identifies with the (possibly infinite) matrix [\pi(y,x)]\_{x,y\in X}.

For what follows, fix a p.m.p. equivalence relation \mathcal{R}\_{0} on a standard probability space (Y,\nu). For each n\in\mathbb{N}\_{\geq 1} let \mathcal{S}\_{n} denote the full equivalence relation on ([n],\nu\_{n}), where \nu\_{n} is the normalized counting measure. Recall also that if (\mathcal{G}\_{1},\mu\_{1}) and (\mathcal{G}\_{2},\mu\_{2}) are discrete p.m.p. groupoids, then their product (\mathcal{G}\_{1}\times\mathcal{G}\_{2},\mu\_{1}\times\mu\_{2}) is again a discrete p.m.p. groupoid with the obvious operations.

Consider now the equivalence relation \mathcal{R}:=\bigsqcup\_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(\mathcal{R}\_{0}\times\mathcal{S}\_{n}), defined on the space X:=\bigsqcup\_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(Y\times[n]), and equipped with the measure \mu:=\sum\_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(\nu\times\nu\_{n}). With the obvious Borel structure, \mathcal{R} becomes a discrete p.m.p. groupoid.

Our construction of the Borel field \pi of probability measures is based on direct sums of finite-dimensional operators (i.e., matrices) whose sequence of norms diverges. The following lemma provides the relevant building blocks.

###### Lemma 4.1.

Let n\in\mathbb{N} be an integer with n>1 and let \delta\in(0,\tfrac{1}{2}). Then there exists a matrix A\_{\delta}:=[A\_{\delta}(i,j)]\_{1\leq i,j\leq n}\in\mathbb{M}\_{n}(\mathbb{C}) with strictly positive entries and column sums \sum\_{i=1}^{n}A\_{\delta}(i,j)=1 for 1\leq j\leq n such that the corresponding operator norm satisfies \|A\_{\delta}\|>\sqrt{n}-\delta.

###### Proof.

For \epsilon\in(0,1), let B(\epsilon) be the matrix whose n rows are identical and equal to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | x\_{\epsilon}:=(1-\epsilon,\tfrac{\epsilon}{n-1},\ldots,\tfrac{\epsilon}{n-1})\,. |  |

Writing \mathbf{1} for the row vector of all ones, we have B(\epsilon)=\mathbf{1}^{T}x\_{\epsilon}. Thus,
