|  | P^{\pi}(\xi\_{k})(k,n)=\sum\_{a\in\mathbb{N}}\pi(k,a)\pi(n,a)=\#(I\_{k}\cap I\_{n}% )=\begin{cases}\#I\_{k}\,,&\text{if }n=k\,,\\[2.845276pt] 0\,,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases} |  |

Hence,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|P^{\pi}(\xi\_{k})\|\_{2}^{2}=\sum\_{m,n\in\mathbb{N}}|P^{\pi}(\xi\_{k})(m,n)|^{2% }=\sum\_{n\in\mathbb{N}}|P^{\pi}(\xi\_{k})(k,n)|^{2}=(\#I\_{k})^{2}=(k+1)^{2}\,, |  |

while

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \|\xi\_{k}\|\_{2}^{2}=\sum\_{m,n\in\mathbb{N}}|\xi\_{k}(m,n)|^{2}=\sum\_{n\in% \mathbb{N}}|\pi(k,n)|^{2}=\sum\_{n\in I\_{k}}1=\#I\_{k}=(k+1)\,. |  |

Consequently,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sup\_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\frac{\|P^{\pi}(\xi\_{k})\|\_{2}}{\|\xi\_{k}\|\_{2}}=\sup\_{k% \in\mathbb{N}}\sqrt{k+1}=\infty\,, |  |

and therefore the Markov operator P^{\pi} is not a bounded operator on L^{2}(\mathcal{R},\mu\_{t}).
