perators on groupoids induced by symmetric Borel fields of probability measures and establish our main results: Theorem B and Theorem C. Finally, we have an appendix that contains examples illustrating that non-symmetric Borel fields of probability measures may give rise to unbounded Markov operators, hence justifying the assumption of symmetry.

## 2. Preliminaries and notation

### 2.1. General notation

We denote by \mathbb{N}:=\{0,1,2\ldots\} the set of non-negative integers, by \mathbb{N}\_{\geq 1}:=\{1,2,\ldots\} the set of positive integers, and [n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\} for n\in\mathbb{N}\_{\geq 1}. For a set S we write \#S for the number of
elements in S and \chi\_{S} for the characteristic function on S. The *symmetric difference* of two sets A and B is denoted by A\bigtriangleup B:=(A\setminus B)\cup(B\setminus A).

### 2.2. Functional-analytic preliminaries

For Banach spaces \mathcal{X} and \mathcal{Y}, we denote the Banach space of all bounded linear operators T:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}, equipped with the operator norm, by \mathbb{B}(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}). In the case where \mathcal{X}=\mathcal{Y}, we abbreviate \mathbb{B}(\mathcal{X}):=\mathbb{B}(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{X}).

The *dual space* \mathcal{X}^{\*}:=\mathbb{B}(\mathcal{X},\mathbb{C}) of \mathcal{X} carries a natural locally convex topology weaker than the norm topology, called the *weak{}^{\*}-topology*, which is generated by the subbase of sets of the form

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \left\{\psi\in\mathcal{X}^{\*}\mid\,|\phi(v)-\psi(v)|<\varepsilon\text{ for % every }v\in F\right\}, |  |

where \phi\in\mathcal{X}^{\ast}, \varepsilon>0, and where F\subseteq\mathcal{X} is finite. By the *Banach–Alaoglu theorem*, the closed unit ball \{\phi\in\mathcal{X}^{\*}\mid\|\phi\|\leq 1\} of \mathcal{X}^{\ast} is compact with respect to this topology.

We will also make use of the *spectral theorem* for bounded self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. Let \mathcal{H} be a Hilbert space and T\in\mathbb{B}(\mathcal{H}) a self-adjoint operator. Then every pair of vectors \xi,\eta\in\mathcal{H} admits a complex Borel measure \mu\_{\xi,\eta} on the spectrum \sigma(T)\subseteq\mathbb{R} of T such that

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \langle T\xi,\eta\rangle=\int\_{\sigma(T)}t\,d\mu\_{\xi,\eta}(t)\,. |  | (2.1) |

If \|\xi\|=1, the measure \mu\_{\xi,\xi} is a probability measure.

Since T is assumed to be self-adjoint, the norm closure C^{\ast}(1,T) of the span of all elements T^{k} with k\in\mathbb{N} is a unital closed subalgebra of \mathbb{B}(\mathcal{H}), which is invariant under taking the adjoint in \mathbb{B}(\mathcal{H}). The *continuous functional calculus* asserts that there exists a unital isometric isomorphism C(\sigma(T))\rightarrow C^{\ast}(1,T), f\mapsto f(T) of algebras which maps \text{id}\_{\sigma(T)}\in C(\sigma(T)) to T. Here C(\sigma(T)) denotes the complex-valued continuous functions on \sigma(T), equipped with the supremum norm. For f\in C(\sigma(T)) the identity in (2.1) then extends via

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \langle f(T)\xi,\eta\rangle=\int\_{\sigma(T)}f(t)\,d\mu\_{\xi,\eta}(t)\quad\text% {for all }\xi,\eta\in\mathcal{H}\,. |  |

Further details on these constructions can be found in Conway’s classical text [Co90].

### 2.3. Invariant means and almost invariant vectors

A *standard measure space* is a pair (Y,\nu) where Y is a standard Borel space and \nu is a \sigma-finite Borel measure on Y. If \nu is a probability measure, then (Y,\nu) is called a *standard probability space*.
