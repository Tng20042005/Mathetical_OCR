Let \mathcal{F} denote the \sigma-algebra generated by E\_{1},\ldots,E\_{k}, and let \nu\in\mathrm{Prob}(\Gamma) be a symmetric probability measure whose support generates \Gamma. There exists a finite partition (A\_{j})\_{1\leq j\leq l} of \mathcal{G}^{(0)} into invariant Borel subsets of positive measure such that \mathcal{F}=\bigl{\{}\bigcup\_{j\in D}A\_{j}\mid D\subseteq[l]\bigr{\}}.

Define \pi\colon\mathcal{G}\to[0,\infty) by \pi(g):=\nu(\{\gamma\in\Gamma\mid g\in\gamma\}). A simple computation shows that \pi is a symmetric Borel field of probability measures. Similarly,

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle(P\_{A\_{j}}^{\pi}\xi)(g) | \displaystyle=\sum\_{h\in\mathcal{G}^{s(g)}}\xi(gh)\,\nu(\{\gamma\in\Gamma\mid h% \in\gamma\}) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\sum\_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\xi(g\gamma)\,\nu(\gamma) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle=\left(\alpha\_{A\_{j}}(\nu)(\xi)\right)(g)\,. |  |

for all 1\leq j\leq l, \xi\in L^{2}(\mathcal{G}|\_{A\_{j}},(\mu\_{A\_{j}})\_{t}), g\in\mathcal{G}|\_{A\_{j}} where \alpha\_{A\_{j}}(\nu):=\sum\_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\nu(\gamma)\alpha\_{A\_{j}}(\gamma), so that P\_{A\_{j}}^{\pi}=\alpha\_{A\_{j}}(\nu). By assumption, \|\alpha\_{A\_{j}}(\nu)\|=\|P\_{A\_{j}}^{\pi}\|=1, so [Ha24, Theorem 2.6] and [Ha24, Theorem 2.7] yield a \Gamma-invariant mean m\_{j}\in L^{\infty}(\mathcal{G}|\_{A\_{j}},(\mu\_{A\_{j}})\_{t})^{\ast}.

Define m\in L^{\infty}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t})^{\ast} by m(f):=\sum\_{j=1}^{l}\mu(A\_{j})\,m\_{j}(f|\_{\mathcal{G}|\_{A\_{j}}}) for f\in L^{\infty}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t}). Since the A\_{j} are invariant and disjoint, m is \Gamma-invariant and satisfies m(\chi\_{A\_{j}})=\mu(A\_{j}) for all 1\leq j\leq l, hence m(\chi\_{E\_{i}})=\mu(E\_{i}) for all i. The result then follows from Theorem [Ha24, Theorem 2.8].

###### Proof of Theorem B.

For the “if” direction assume that the discrete p.m.p. groupoid (\mathcal{G},\mu) satisfies Kesten’s criterion. For a countable subgroup \Gamma\leq[\mathcal{G}] and a finite tuple \mathbf{E}=(E\_{1},\ldots,E\_{k}) of invariant Borel subsets of positive measure, let \mathcal{M}\_{\Gamma,\mathbf{E}} denote the set of \Gamma-invariant means m\in L^{\infty}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t})^{\ast} with m(\chi\_{E\_{i}})=\mu(E\_{i}) for 1\leq i\leq k. By Lemma 3.6, each \mathcal{M}\_{\Gamma,\mathbf{E}} is non-empty and weak{}^{\ast}-compact.

By the finite intersection property the intersection \bigcap\_{\Gamma,\mathbf{E}}\mathcal{M}\_{\Gamma,\mathbf{E}} is non-empty. Hence there exists a [\mathcal{G}]-invariant mean m\in L^{\infty}(\mathcal{G},\mu\_{t})^{\*} satisfying m(\chi\_{E})=\mu(E) for every invariant Borel subset E\subseteq\mathcal{G}^{(0)}. By [Ha24, Theorem 2.8], m(f)=\int\_{\mathcal{G}^{(0)}}f\,d\mu for all f\in L^{\infty}(\mathcal{G}^{(0)},\mu), and Lemma 3.3 then implies that (\mathcal{G},\mu) is amenable.

For the “only if” direction assume that (\mathcal{G},\mu) is amenable. Let \pi\colon\mathcal{G}\to[0,\infty) be a symmetric Borel field of probability measures and let E\subseteq\mathcal{G}^{(0)} be an invariant Borel subset with \mu(E)>0. Lemma 3.1 shows that \|P\_{E}^{\pi}\|\leq 1.
