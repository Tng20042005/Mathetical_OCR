###### Theorem 1 (Erdős and Sós, [21])

For all n\geq 3,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | f(n,2)=\begin{cases}n,&\mbox{if}\ n\equiv 0\pmod{4},\\ n-1,&\mbox{if}\ n\equiv 1\pmod{4},\\ n-2,&\mbox{if}\ n\equiv 2,3\pmod{4}.\\ \end{cases} |  |

###### Theorem 2 (Chung and Frankl, [2])

Suppose that k\geq 3 is odd and n>k(k-1)(5k+2)/2, then f(n,k)=(n-2k)k(k-1))+2{k\choose 3}. Moreover, a 3-graph \mathcal{F} has f(n,k) edges and contains no k-star if and only if \mathcal{F} is isomorphic to \mathscr{F}\_{k}^{o}.

###### Theorem 3 (Chung and Frankl, [2])

Suppose that k\geq 4 is even and n>2k^{3}-9k+7, then f(n,k)=\frac{1}{2}nk(2k-3)-\frac{1}{2}(2k^{3}-9k+6). Moreover, a 3-graph \mathcal{F} has f(n,k) edges and contains no k-star if and only if \mathcal{F} is isomorphic to \mathscr{F}\_{k}^{e}.

Chung and Frankl [2] proposed the following extremal graph construction.

The construction of \mathscr{F}\_{k}^{o} : Let k be odd and let S and R be two disjoint sets of [n] of size k. Consider the 3-graph \mathscr{F}\_{k}^{o} with vertex set [n] and edge set

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | E(\mathscr{F}\_{k}^{o})=\{T\in\binom{V}{3}:|T\cap S|\geq 2\ \mbox{ and }\ |T% \cap R|=\emptyset\}\cup\{T\in\binom{V}{3}:|T\cap R|\geq 2\ \mbox{ and }\ |T% \cap S|=\emptyset\}. |  |

The construction of \mathscr{F}\_{k}^{e}: Let k be even. Let G\_{k} be
the 2-graph with 2k-1 vertices, denoted by x\_{1},\ldots,x\_{k-1},y\_{1},\ldots,y\_{k-1} and z. The edge set of G\_{k} consists of all the pairs (x\_{i},y\_{j}), except for (x\_{i},y\_{i})
with 2i>k together with the pairs (x\_{i},z),(y\_{i},z) with 2i>k. It is easy to see that it has all degrees equal k-1
except for the degree of z, which is k-2. Let \mathscr{F}\_{k}^{e} denote the 3-graph on n vertices such that each edge either intersects the vertex set V(G\_{k}) in an edge of G\_{k} or contains two distinct edges of G\_{k}, together with all the triples of the form \{x\_{i},y\_{i},z\} for 1\leq i\leq k/2.

The anti-Ramsey number ar\_{3}(n,\mathcal{F}\_{2})=2 follows immediately from the definition. Tang, Li and Yan [23] determined the value of ar\_{3}(n,\mathcal{F}\_{3}) when n\geq 20.

###### Theorem 4 (Tang, Li and Yan [23])

For all n\geq 20,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | ar\_{3}(n,\mathcal{F}\_{3})=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ll}f(n,2)+2,&\mbox{if}\ n% \equiv 0\pmod{4},\\ f(n,2)+2,&\mbox{if}\ n\equiv 1\pmod{4},\\ f(n,2)+3,&\mbox{if}\ n\equiv 2,3\pmod{4}.\end{array}\right. |  |

In this paper, we determine the anti-Ramsey number of a star in 3-graphs for sufficiently large n.

###### Theorem 5

For k\geq 3 and n>\frac{5}{2}k^{3}+\frac{15}{2}k^{2}+26k-3, ar\_{3}(n,\mathcal{F}\_{k+1})=f(n,k)+2.

###### Theorem 6 (Tutte, [24])

A graph G has a perfect matching if and only if

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | o(G-S)\leq|S|\quad\mbox{for any }S\subseteq V(G), |  |

where o(G-S) denotes the number of connected components of odd order in G-S.
