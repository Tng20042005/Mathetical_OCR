Proof. Otherwise, suppose that the result does not hold. Then there exists f\in E(G) such that G-f is not factor-critical. Then by Lemma 7, there exists S\subseteq V(G) such that o(G-f-S)\geq|S|+1. Recall that \delta(G)\geq k-2 and G contains at most one vertex of degree k-2.

Claim 1. G is (k-2)-edge-connected.

Otherwise, suppose that there exists M\subseteq E(G) such that |M|\leq k-3 and G-M is not connected. Let F\_{1} and F\_{2} be two connected components of G-M such that |V(F\_{1})|\leq|V(F\_{2})|. Since \delta(G)\geq k-2, then we have 2\leq|V(F\_{1})|\leq k-1.
So we have

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle|M| | \displaystyle\geq e\_{G}(V(F\_{1}),V(G)-V(F\_{1})) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq|V(F\_{1})|(k-|V(F\_{1})|)-1 |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq k-2, |  |

which contradicts the hypothesis that |M|\leq k-3. This completes the proof of Claim 1.

By Claim 1, we have q\geq 2. Let C\_{1},\ldots,C\_{q} denote these odd components of G-S-f such that |V(C\_{1})|\geq\cdots\geq|V(C\_{q})|.

Claim 2. |V(C\_{1})|\geq k.

Otherwise, suppose |V(C\_{1})|\leq k-1. Then for 1\leq i\leq q, e\_{G}(V(C\_{i}),V(G)-V(C\_{i}))\geq k-2 with equality if and only if the vertex of degree k-2 in G belongs to C\_{i}. Thus

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle(k-1)|S| | \displaystyle\geq\sum\_{x\in S}d\_{G}(x) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq\sum\_{i=1}^{q}e\_{G}(S,V(C\_{i})) |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | \displaystyle\geq(k-1)(|s|+1)-3 |  |
