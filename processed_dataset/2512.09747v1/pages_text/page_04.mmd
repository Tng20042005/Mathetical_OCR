A graph G is called a *factor-critical* graph if G-v has a perfect matching for each v\in V(G).
Gallai [12] introduced the concept of factor-critical graphs.
By definition and Theorem 6, one can see that the following statement holds.

###### Lemma 7 (Gallai, [12])

A graph G of odd order is factor-critical if and only if

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | o(G-S)\leq|S|\quad\mbox{for any non-emptyset }S\subseteq V(G), |  |

where o(G-S) denotes the number of connected components of odd order in G-S.

Here we use a “weight function” method developed by Chung and Frankl [2] to characterize the structure of a 3-graph \mathcal{F}.
Suppose that \mathcal{F} is a family of 3-element subsets of the n-set V=V(\mathcal{F}). Let P denote the set of all pairs of vertices in V. For each \{u,v\} in P, the pair frequency is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | z(u,v)=|\{w:\{u,v,w\}\in\mathcal{F}\}|. |  |

We also have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle A:=\{\{u,v\}\in P:z(u,v)\geq 2k-1\} |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle B:=\{\{u,v\}\in P:2k-2\geq z(u,v)\geq k\} |  |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \displaystyle C:=P-A-B |  |

The weight function \omega:\mathcal{F}\times P\rightarrow R distributes weights to pairs within each triple in \mathcal{F} according to the pair frequency.

For a fixed triple T\in\mathcal{F}, the three pairs in T are denoted by z(p\_{1})\geq z(p\_{2})\geq z(p\_{3}). The *weight function* w is defined as follows:

* •

  If p\_{1},p\_{2},p\_{3}\in A\cup B or p\_{1},p\_{2},p\_{3}\in B\cup C, then \omega(T,p\_{i})=\frac{1}{3}.
* •

  Suppose p\_{1}\in A,p\_{3}\in C. If p\_{2}\in A\cup B, then \omega(T,p\_{1})=\omega(T,p\_{2})=\frac{1}{2},\omega(T,p\_{3})=0. If p\_{2}\in C, then \omega(T,p\_{1})=1,\omega(T,p\_{2})=\omega(T,p\_{3})=0.
* •

  For convenience we set also \omega(T,p)=0 for p\nsubseteq T.

Obviously, we have

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{1\leq i\leq 3}\omega(T,p\_{i})=1 |  |

and

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sum\_{T\in\mathcal{F}}{\sum\_{p}\omega(T,p)}=e(\mathcal{F}) |  |

###### Lemma 8 ([2, 25])

For every vertex v in a 3-graph \mathcal{F} which does not contain a k-star, the following holds:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | W\_{v}=\sum\_{p\in N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v)}\omega(\{v\}\cup p,p)\leq k(k-1). |  |

Moreover W\_{v}\leq k(k-1)-\frac{2}{3} unless N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v) is the disjoint of two complete 2-graphs on k vertices and every edge of N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v) is A-type. If k is even, then one has the stronger inequality,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | W\_{v}\leq k(k-3/2) |  |
