we can find a rainbow copy of \mathcal{F}\_{k+1} in \mathcal{G} with core y\_{1}, a contradiction. This completes the proof of Claim 12.

Claim 13. For any T\in{[n]-(V(F\_{0}-z)\cup\{x\})\choose 2}\setminus E(F), c(T\cup\{x\})\in\mathcal{C}^{\prime}.

Suppose to the contrary that there exists T\in{[n]-(V(F\_{0})\cup\{x\})\choose 2}\setminus E(F) such that c(T\cup\{x\})\notin\mathcal{C}^{\prime}. Write T=\{x\_{0},y\_{0}\}. By Claims 8, 9, 10 and 11, we have T\cap U\_{k}\neq\emptyset. Without loss generality, suppose that x\_{0}\in U\_{k}. Then d\_{F}(x\_{0})=k-1.
Let w\in V(F\_{0})-N\_{F}(x\_{0}) such that d\_{F\_{0}}(w)=k-1. By Claim 12, we have c(\{w,x,x\_{0}\})\in\{c(p\cup\{x\})\ |\ p\in E(F)\}\cup\{c\_{1}\}. Thus it follows that c(\{w,x,x\_{0}\})\neq c(\{x,x\_{0},y\_{0}\}). By Claim 5, we can find a rainbow copy of \mathcal{F}\_{k+1} with core x\_{0}, a contradiction. This completes the proof of Claim 13.

By Claims 8,9,10,11,12 and 13, for any e\in{[n]-x\choose 2}, c(e\cup\{x\})\in\mathcal{C^{\prime}}. Thus we can derive that the inequality (7) holds. This complete the proof of Theorem 5. \Box
