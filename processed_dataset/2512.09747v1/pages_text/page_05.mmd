Moreover, W\_{v}\leq k(k-3/2)-1/2 unless N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v)=K\_{k-1}\cup C, where C is a factor-critical graph of order k+1 with degree sequence k-1,\ldots,k-1,k-2 or N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v) with maximum degree k-1 satisfies the following three conditions.

* (a)

  There exists S\subseteq V(N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v)) such that N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v)-S consists of isolated vertices and one factor-critical component denoted by F\_{0} with 2k-1-2|S|\geq k+1 vertices and degree sequence (k-1,...,k-1,k-2);
* (b)

  N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v)-V(F\_{0}) is the edge disjoint union of |S| stars, each with maximum degree k-1; and
* (c)

  every edge of N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v) is in A, and all edges connecting v to V(N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v)) are in C.

Chung and Frankl [2] first determined the value of f(n,k), though they did not characterize the corresponding extremal case: when N\_{\mathcal{F}}(v)=K\_{k-1}\cup C (where C is a factor-critical graph of order k+1 with degree sequence (k-1,\dots,k-1,k-2)). Later, Zhu et al. [25] adopted a similar approach to fully characterize all extremal graphs (a method analogous to the one Chung and Frankl used in [2] when handling the function \text{ex}\_{3}(n,\mathcal{F}\_{k})).

Write c(n,k):=ex\_{3}(n,\mathcal{F}\_{k})+2. Given an edge-coloring c:E(K^{3}\_{n})\rightarrow[c(n,k)] such that c is surjective and the colored hypergraph denoted by H contains no rainbow \mathcal{F}\_{k+1}. For U\subseteq V(H), let Z\_{c}(U):=\{c(e)\ |\ e\in H,U\subseteq e\} and let z\_{c}(U):=|Z\_{c}(U)|. When U=\{x\}, we denote Z\_{c}(U) and z\_{c}(U) by Z\_{c}(x) and z\_{c}(x), respectively.
If z\_{c}(\{u,v\})\leq 3k, the pair \{u,v\} is *good* in H, saying *bad*, otherwise.

###### Lemma 9

There exist 2k+6 disjoint good pairs in H.

Proof. Firstly, we show that the following claim.

Claim 1. For every u, there exist at least n-k-1 vertices v\in V(H) such that z\_{c}(u,v)\leq 3k.

By contradiction. Suppose the result does not hold. Then there exists u\in V(H) and S\in{V(H)-u\choose k+1} such that z\_{c}(u,v)\geq 3k+1 for all v\in S. Write S:=\{v\_{1},\ldots,v\_{k+1}\}. We choose a maximal rainbow star \mathcal{F}\_{r} in H with center u such that V(\mathcal{F}\_{r})\cap S=r. Since H is a complete graph, we may choose e\_{1} such that \{u,v\_{1}\}\subseteq e\_{1} and |e\_{1}\cap S|=1. So we have V(\mathcal{F}\_{r})\neq\emptyset. Next we show that r\geq k+1, which will contradict the hypothesis. Otherwise, suppose that r\leq k. Then let v\in S-V(\mathcal{F}\_{r}). Since z\_{c}(u,v)\geq 3k+1 and the number of edges containing \{u,v\} and intersecting V(\mathcal{F}\_{r})-u is at most 2r, there exists an edge f containing \{u,v\} and f-\{u,v\}\notin V(\mathcal{F}\_{r}) and c(f)\notin\{c(e)\ |\ e\in\mathcal{F}\_{r}\}. So \{f\}\cup E(\mathcal{F}\_{r}) induces a rainbow \mathcal{F}\_{r+1}, which contradicts the choice of \mathcal{F}\_{r}. This completes the proof of claim 1.

Since n-k-1>2(2k+6), by Claim 1, we may greedily choose a set of 2k+6 vertex-disjoint good pairs in H. This completes the proof. \Box

The following lemma is crucial for the proof of our main theorem.

###### Lemma 10

Let k\geq 5 be an integer and let G be a graph with at most 2k-1 vertices. If G contains at most one vertex of degree k-2 and the rest vertices has degree k-1, then for any f\in E(G), G-f is also factor-critical.
