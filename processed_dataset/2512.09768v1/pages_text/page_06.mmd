G^{\sigma} is a balanced complete bipartite signed graph K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}}^{\sigma} with n\_{1},n\_{2}\geq 2 and \lambda=0.

###### Proof.

Let \lambda be an eigenvalue of A(G^{\sigma}).
By interlacing (Lemma 2) applied to any induced g(G^{\sigma})-cycle,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)\leq n-g(G^{\sigma})+2. |  |

Assume equality holds.
We distinguish cases according to the switching class of G^{\sigma}.

Case 1: G^{\sigma} is balanced.
By Lemma 1, G^{\sigma} is switching-equivalent to (G,+), so
m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=m(G,\lambda).
Applying Lemma 3, the only connected graph achieving the bound is K\_{n} with \lambda=-1.
Thus G^{\sigma} is a balanced complete signed graph K\_{n}^{\sigma}.

Case 2: G^{\sigma} is antibalanced.
Switching equivalence yields G^{\sigma}\sim(G,-), where every edge is negative.
Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | A(G^{\sigma})=-A(G), |  |

and hence \lambda has multiplicity n-1 if and only if -\lambda has multiplicity n-1 in G.
By Lemma 3, this occurs exactly when G\cong K\_{n} and -\lambda=-1, i.e. \lambda=1.
Thus G^{\sigma} is an antibalanced complete signed graph.

Case 3: G^{\sigma} contains no triangles (so g(G^{\sigma})=4).
If G^{\sigma} is balanced, we may switch to (G,+).
Applying Lemma 5 to G, it follows that G\cong K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}} with n\_{1},n\_{2}\geq 2 and \lambda=0.
Thus G^{\sigma} is a balanced complete bipartite signed graph.

These three cases exhaust all possibilities, completing the proof.
