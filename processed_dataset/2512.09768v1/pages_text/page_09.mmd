for some real \lambda if and only if G^{\sigma} is one of the following:

1. (i)

   a balanced cycle with

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \lambda=2\cos\Bigl{(}\frac{2\pi j}{g}\Bigr{)},\qquad j=1,2,\dots,\Bigl{\lceil}% \frac{g}{2}\Bigr{\rceil}-1; |  |
2. (ii)

   an unbalanced cycle with

   |  |  |  |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   |  | \lambda=2\cos\Bigl{(}\frac{(2j+1)\pi}{g}\Bigr{)},\qquad j=0,1,\dots,\Bigl{% \lceil}\frac{g-1}{2}\Bigr{\rceil}-1. |  |

###### Proof.

Since g(C\_{n}^{\sigma})=n, the condition becomes

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(C\_{n}^{\sigma},\lambda)=2. |  |

We use the explicit eigenvalues of signed cycles.

Balanced cycle.
Balanced cycle eigenvalues (Lemma 6(i)) satisfy

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}=2\cos\Bigl{(}\frac{2\pi j}{n}\Bigr{)},\qquad\lambda\_{j}=\lambda\_{n% -j}. |  |

Thus every eigenvalue has multiplicity 2 except:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j=0\quad(\lambda=2),\qquad j=n/2\text{ when $n$ is even }(\lambda=-2). |  |

Hence the multiplicity-two eigenvalues are

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}=2\cos\Bigl{(}\frac{2\pi j}{n}\Bigr{)},\qquad j=1,\dots,\Bigl{% \lceil}\frac{n}{2}\Bigr{\rceil}-1. |  |

Unbalanced cycle.
Unbalanced cycle eigenvalues (Lemma 6(ii)) satisfy

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}=2\cos\Bigl{(}\frac{(2j+1)\pi}{n}\Bigr{)},\qquad\lambda\_{j}=\lambda% \_{n-1-j}. |  |

Thus every eigenvalue has multiplicity 2 except the possible simple eigenvalue -2 when n is odd.
Hence the multiplicity-two eigenvalues are

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}=2\cos\Bigl{(}\frac{(2j+1)\pi}{n}\Bigr{)},\qquad j=0,\dots,\Bigl{% \lceil}\frac{n-1}{2}\Bigr{\rceil}-1. |  |

Replacing n by g in both cases yields the statements (i) and (ii).
The converse is immediate from Lemma 6.

## 5 Conclusion and Future Directions

In this paper we established a sharp upper bound for the multiplicity of any real eigenvalue
\lambda of a connected signed graph G^{\sigma} in terms of its girth. Specifically, we showed that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)\leq n-g(G^{\sigma})+2, |  |

and we completely characterized all signed graphs attaining equality.
The extremal cases are precisely the balanced and antibalanced complete signed graphs, as well as
the balanced complete bipartite signed graphs, corresponding to the eigenvalues -1, 1, and 0,
respectively. These results fully generalize the theorem of Wu et al. [37], which treated
only the special case \lambda=0, and they reveal a unified structural principle: equality holds
exactly when the adjacency matrix exhibits minimal possible rank compatible with the girth.

We further analyzed signed cycles in detail and determined all eigenvalues that occur with
multiplicity 1 or 2. Using explicit spectral formulas, we obtained complete characterizations of
balanced and unbalanced cycles realizing

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-g(G^{\sigma})+q,\qquad q\in\{1,2\}. |  |

These results illustrate how the interplay between cycle parity, balance, and switching equivalence
governs the spectrum of signed cycles.

Future work.
The results presented here suggest several natural directions for further research:

* •

  Laplacian eigenvalue multiplicities.
  Extending our girth-based multiplicity bounds to the signed Laplacian or the A\_{\alpha}-matrix
  may reveal new relationships between structural balance and spectral extremality.
* •

  Beyond girth: cycle rank and cyclomatic number.
  Since the cyclomatic number measures the complexity of cycle space, it would be interesting to
  derive multiplicity bounds involving both girth and cyclomatic number, generalizing results such
  as those of Ma et al. [22] and Tam–Huang [30].
* •

  Higher multiplicity phenomena.
  The extremal patterns identified for complete and complete bipartite signed graphs raise the
  question of whether similar structural characterizations exist for multiplicities of the form
  m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-g(G^{\sigma})+k for k>2.
* •

  Random and sparse signed graphs.
  Investigating typical multiplicity behavior in random signed graphs or sparse models may provide
  probabilistic analogues of our extremal results.
* •

  Algorithmic detection of extremal switching classes.
  Since the extremal graphs are defined up to switching, developing efficient algorithms to detect
  whether a signed graph lies in one of the extremal switching classes would have practical
  applications in network analysis.

Overall, the results of this paper highlight how cycle structure, balance, and switching equivalence
interact to control eigenvalue multiplicities in signed graphs. We hope that the techniques
developed here will serve as a foundation for further investigations in signed spectral graph theory.
