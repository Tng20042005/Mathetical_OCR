a(e)=-1 are negative. When all edges are positive (resp. negative), we write (G,+) (resp. (G,-)). Signed graphs capture systems where interactions may be cooperative or antagonistic, and they naturally incorporate notions such as balance, switching equivalence, and parity of cycles.

Background and classical results.
The multiplicities of eigenvalues of Hermitian and real symmetric matrices associated with graphs have been studied extensively. Parter–Wiener theory, developed in [23, 35] and later extended in [17, 18], provides important tools for understanding how graph structure influences eigenvalue multiplicity. Star complement techniques have been fruitfully applied to obtain upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities [5]. Multiplicities of adjacency eigenvalues also carry structural meaning. For example, the nullity (multiplicity of 0) plays a central role in chemical graph theory [1]. Among connected graphs of order n\geq 2, the eigenvalue 0 attains its maximum multiplicity n-2 in complete bipartite graphs K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}}, while the eigenvalue -1 attains multiplicity n-1 in the complete graph K\_{n}. Motivated by these extremal cases, several works—including [24, 38, 19, 27, 28, 2]—have investigated graphs with large multiplicities of specific eigenvalues.

Structural parameters and eigenvalue multiplicities.
A parallel line of research relates eigenvalue multiplicities to structural parameters such as girth, matching number, cyclomatic number, diameter, and pendant vertices. Cámara and Haemers [6] showed that multiplicity patterns characterize almost complete graphs. Cioabă et al. [12] investigated sparse graphs with all but two eigenvalues equal to \pm 1. Wang [34] obtained multiplicity bounds in terms of diameter. Ma et al. [22] and Tam and Huang [30] linked nullity to pendant vertices and the cycle space, while Wang et al. [31] extended these ideas to arbitrary eigenvalues. In [32], the multiplicity of -1 was related to pendant vertices in trees. Further results related to girth, extremal multiplicity, and eigenvalue structure appear in [39, 26, 7, 13, 16, 33, 9, 21, 14, 15, 36, 8].

Signed graphs and spectral multiplicities.
Since signed graphs generalize ordinary graphs, it is natural to examine how switching equivalence, balance, and signed cycle structure affect eigenvalue multiplicities. Recent studies such as [3, 25, 20, 11] have developed spectral characterizations for signed graphs, including results on nullity, balance, and extremal configurations. Extending multiplicity bounds from unsigned graphs to signed graphs introduces additional challenges: cycle signs interact with eigenvectors, switching can alter the adjacency matrix without changing the spectrum, and balance imposes structural constraints not present in the unsigned setting.

Motivation and gap in the literature.
While the nullity of signed graphs (the case \lambda=0) has been thoroughly studied, far less is known about the multiplicity of an *arbitrary* eigenvalue \lambda. A major recent advance is due to Wu et al. [37], who proved a sharp bound for m(G^{\sigma},0) in terms of girth and characterized all cases of equality. However, their result applies only to the eigenvalue 0. Extending the same bound to all eigenvalues is nontrivial: general eigenvalues lack direct combinatorial interpretations, interact differently with signed cycles, and require a deeper analysis of switching classes and induced substructures.

Contributions of this paper.
In this work, we establish a sharp upper bound on the multiplicity m(G^{\sigma},\lambda) of *any* real eigenvalue \lambda of a connected signed graph G^{\sigma} of order n and girth g(G^{\sigma}):

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)\leq n-g(G^{\sigma})+2. |  |

We completely determine all signed graphs achieving equality. Equality holds if and only if G^{\sigma} is:

* •

  a balanced complete signed graph K\_{n}^{\sigma} with \lambda=-1,
* •

  an antibalanced complete signed graph K\_{n}^{\sigma} with \lambda=1, or
* •

  a balanced complete bipartite signed graph K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}}^{\sigma} (with n\_{1},n\_{2}\geq 2) with \lambda=0.

We also fully characterize signed cycles satisfying m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-g(G^{\sigma})+q for q\in\{1,2\}. Our results extend and generalize those of Wu et al. [37], whose theorem applies only to \lambda=0.

For convenience, we restate their result here:

###### Theorem 1.

[37]
Let G^{\sigma} be a connected signed graph of order n and girth g(G^{\sigma}). Then
m(G^{\sigma},0)\leq n-g(G^{\sigma})+2, with equality if and only if G^{\sigma} is one of the following:
(i) a balanced complete bipartite signed graph with g(G^{\sigma})=4;
(ii) a positive (resp., negative) signed cycle (C\_{g},\sigma) with g(G^{\sigma})\equiv 0\pmod{4} (resp., g(G^{\sigma})\equiv 2\pmod{4}).

Structure of the paper.
Section 2 provides essential definitions and preliminaries.
Section 3 establishes the main multiplicity bound and the equality characterization.
Section 4 fully characterizes signed cycles with m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-g(G^{\sigma})+q for q=1,2.
