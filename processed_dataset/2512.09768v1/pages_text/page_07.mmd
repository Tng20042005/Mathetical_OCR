|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-g(G^{\sigma})+q,\qquad q\in\{1,2\}. |  |

Since a cycle C\_{n}^{\sigma} has g(C\_{n}^{\sigma})=n, the condition simplifies to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(C\_{n}^{\sigma},\lambda)=q. |  |

Thus we determine all eigenvalues of signed cycles with multiplicity 1 and 2.
The analysis follows directly from the explicit eigenvalue formulas for signed cycles.

We recall the well–known spectral formulas (see [4]):

###### Lemma 6.

[4]
Let C\_{n}^{\sigma} and P\_{n}^{\sigma} denote a signed cycle and a signed path on n vertices, respectively. Then:

1. (i)

   \displaystyle\mathrm{Spec}\_{A}(C\_{n},+)=\bigl{\{}\,2\cos(2\pi j/n)\,\big{|}\,j%
   =0,1,\dots,n-1\,\bigr{\}}.
2. (ii)

   \displaystyle\mathrm{Spec}\_{A}(C\_{n},\bar{\sigma})=\bigl{\{}\,2\cos((2j+1)\pi/%
   n)\,\big{|}\,j=0,1,\dots,n-1\,\bigr{\}}.
3. (iii)

   \displaystyle\mathrm{Spec}\_{A}(P\_{n},\sigma)=\bigl{\{}\,2\cos(j\pi/(n+1))\,%
   \big{|}\,j=1,2,\dots,n\,\bigr{\}}.

These formulas allow a complete characterization of multiplicity-one and multiplicity-two eigenvalues of signed cycles.

###### Theorem 4.

Let G^{\sigma} be a connected signed graph of order n and girth g(G^{\sigma}).
Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-g(G^{\sigma})+1 |  |

for some real \lambda if and only if G^{\sigma} is one of the following:

1. (i)

   a balanced cycle with \lambda=2;
2. (ii)

   a balanced cycle of even order with \lambda=-2;
3. (iii)

   an unbalanced cycle of odd order with \lambda=-2.

###### Proof.

Since m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-g(G^{\sigma})+1, and a cycle satisfies g(C\_{n}^{\sigma})=n, we obtain

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(C\_{n}^{\sigma},\lambda)=1. |  |

Thus \lambda must be a simple (multiplicity-one) eigenvalue of C\_{n}^{\sigma}.

Balanced cycle.
From Lemma 6(i),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}=2\cos(2\pi j/n). |  |

The symmetry \lambda\_{j}=\lambda\_{n-j} implies that all eigenvalues occur in pairs except when

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j=n-j\pmod{n}. |  |

This occurs for:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad\lambda=2, |  |

and for j=n/2 when n is even, giving

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda=-2. |  |

Thus the balanced cycle has simple eigenvalues
