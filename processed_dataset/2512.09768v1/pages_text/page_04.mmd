Interlacing.
We recall the classical Cauchy interlacing theorem (see [16]), which will be used repeatedly to bound eigenvalue multiplicities.

###### Theorem 2 (Cauchy’s Interlacing Theorem).

Let C be a real symmetric n\times n matrix and let D be an (n-1)\times(n-1) principal submatrix of C.
If \lambda\_{1}\geq\cdots\geq\lambda\_{n} and \mu\_{1}\geq\cdots\geq\mu\_{n-1} are the eigenvalues of C and D respectively, then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}\geq\mu\_{j}\geq\lambda\_{j+1},\qquad j=1,\dots,n-1. |  |

Since the adjacency matrix of an induced subgraph is a principal submatrix of the adjacency matrix of the full graph, we immediately obtain the interlacing theorem for signed graphs:

###### Lemma 2 (Interlacing Theorem for signed graphs).

Let G^{\sigma} be a signed graph of order n with eigenvalues \lambda\_{1}\geq\dots\geq\lambda\_{n}, and let H^{\sigma} be an induced subgraph of G^{\sigma} with m vertices and eigenvalues \mu\_{1}\geq\dots\geq\mu\_{m}. Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}\geq\mu\_{j}\geq\lambda\_{n-m+j},\qquad j=1,2,\dots,m. |  |

This lemma implies that the eigenvalues of any induced subgraph “interlace” those of the original signed graph, and it will be a key tool for deriving upper bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities in the sequel.

## 3 Bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities of signed graphs

Throughout this section we assume that g(G^{\sigma})<n, thereby excluding the case in which
G^{\sigma} itself is a g(G^{\sigma})-cycle. That case will be treated separately in Section 4.

###### Lemma 3.

Let G be a connected graph of order n and girth g(G). Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G,\lambda)=n-g(G)+2 |  |

for some \lambda\in\mathbb{R} if and only if G\cong K\_{n} (n\geq 3) and \lambda=-1.

###### Proof.

For K\_{n} we have A(K\_{n})=J-I\_{n}, where J is the all-ones matrix.
Since \mathrm{Spec}(J)=\{0^{(n-1)},n^{(1)}\} and J commutes with I\_{n}, it follows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathrm{Spec}(K\_{n})=\{(n-1)^{(1)},\,(-1)^{(n-1)}\}. |  |

Thus m(K\_{n},-1)=n-1.
Because g(K\_{n})=3, we obtain

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(K\_{n},-1)=n-1=n-3+2=n-g(K\_{n})+2. |  |

Conversely, assume m(G,\lambda)=n-g(G)+2.
For \lambda to have multiplicity n-1, the only connected graphs with an eigenvalue of multiplicity n-1 are K\_{n} and the star K\_{1,n-1}.
Since K\_{1,n-1} has no cycles (girth undefined), it cannot satisfy g(G)=3.
Hence G\cong K\_{n}, and the eigenvalue of multiplicity n-1 is \lambda=-1.
