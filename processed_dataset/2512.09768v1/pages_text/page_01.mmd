###### Abstract

The study of eigenvalue multiplicities plays a central role in the spectral theory of signed graphs, extending several classical results from the unsigned setting. While most existing work focuses on the nullity of a signed graph (the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0), much less is known for arbitrary eigenvalues. In this paper we establish a sharp upper bound for the multiplicity m(G\_{\sigma},\lambda) of any real eigenvalue \lambda of a connected signed graph G\_{\sigma} in terms of its girth.

Our main result shows that

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G\_{\sigma},\lambda)\leq n-g(G\_{\sigma})+2, |  |

where n is the number of vertices and g(G\_{\sigma}) is the girth. We prove that equality holds if and only if G\_{\sigma} is switching equivalent to one of the following extremal families:
(i) a balanced complete graph and \lambda=-1;
(ii) an antibalanced complete graph and \lambda=1; or
(iii) a balanced complete bipartite graph and \lambda=0.
This completely extends and generalizes the known result for the nullity case (\lambda=0), originally due to Wu et al. (2022), to the full eigenvalue spectrum.

Our approach combines Cauchy interlacing, switching equivalence, and a structural analysis of induced cycles in signed graphs. We also provide a detailed characterization of eigenvalues with multiplicity 1 and 2 for signed cycles. Several examples are included to illustrate the sharpness and the spectral behavior of the extremal families.

## 1 Introduction

Throughout this paper, we assume that all graphs are simple and undirected, containing neither loops nor multiple edges. Let G=(V,E) be a simple graph of order |V|=n. We write v\_{i}\sim v\_{j} to indicate that the vertices v\_{i} and v\_{j} in G are adjacent. The neighborhood of a vertex v\_{i} in G is defined as N\_{G}(v\_{i})=\{\,v\_{j}\in V(G):v\_{j}\sim v\_{i}\}. A graph H is called a *subgraph* of G if V(H)\subseteq V(G) and E(H)\subseteq E(G). Furthermore, H is an *induced subgraph* of G if for each v\in V(H), we have N\_{H}(v)=N\_{G}(v)\cap V(H). Equivalently, v\_{i} and v\_{j} are adjacent in H if and only if they are adjacent in G. The *adjacency matrix* A(G)=[a\_{ij}] of G is defined by a\_{ij}=1 whenever v\_{i}\sim v\_{j} and 0 otherwise. Since A(G) is real symmetric, all eigenvalues are real and can be ordered as \lambda\_{1}\geq\lambda\_{2}\geq\dots\geq\lambda\_{n}. The *spectrum* of G, denoted \mathrm{Spec}\_{A}(G), is the multiset of eigenvalues of A(G). The *rank* of G, denoted \operatorname{rk}(G), is the rank of A(G). For an eigenvalue \lambda of A(G), its *multiplicity* is denoted by m(G,\lambda).

A *signed graph* is a natural extension of an ordinary graph in which each edge carries a positive or negative sign. Formally, a signed graph G^{\sigma}=(G,\sigma) consists of an underlying graph G=(V,E) together with a sign function \sigma:E\to\{+1,-1\}, where edges with \sigma(e)=+1 are positive and those with \sigm
