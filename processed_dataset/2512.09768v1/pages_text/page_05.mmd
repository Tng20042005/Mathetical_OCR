It is well known (see [29, 10]) that the connected graphs of rank 2 are exactly complete bipartite graphs:

###### Lemma 4.

[29, 10]
Let G be a connected graph of order n.
Then \operatorname{rk}(G)=2 if and only if G\cong K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}} with n\_{1},n\_{2}\geq 1.

###### Lemma 5.

Let G be a connected graph of order n and girth g(G).
Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G,\lambda)=n-g(G)+2 |  |

for some \lambda\in\mathbb{R} if and only if G\cong K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}} with n\_{1},n\_{2}>1 and \lambda=0.

###### Proof.

Sufficiency.
If G\cong K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}} with n\_{1},n\_{2}>1, then g(G)=4 and

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \mathrm{Spec}(G)=\{\sqrt{n\_{1}n\_{2}},\,-\sqrt{n\_{1}n\_{2}},\,0^{(n-2)}\}. |  |

Thus m(G,0)=n-2=n-4+2=n-g(G)+2.

Necessity.
Assume m(G,\lambda)=n-g+2. Then

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{rank}(\lambda I-A(G))=g-2. |  |

Let C be a shortest cycle of G.
Since A(C) is a principal submatrix of A(G), interlacing implies

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{rank}(\lambda I-A(C))\leq g-2. |  |

The only cycle for which \operatorname{rank}(\lambda I-A(C))\leq g-2 is a 4-cycle, because for g\geq 5 the matrix
\lambda I-A(C) has rank at least g-1.
Hence g=4, so

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{rank}(\lambda I-A(G))=2. |  |

Thus \operatorname{rank}(A(G))=2, and by Lemma 4, G\cong K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}}.
Since both parts must contain at least two vertices to have girth 4, we obtain n\_{1},n\_{2}>1.
Finally, because the only eigenvalue of multiplicity n-2 in \mathrm{Spec}(K\_{n\_{1},n\_{2}}) is 0, we conclude \lambda=0.
∎

###### Theorem 3.

Let G^{\sigma} be a connected signed graph of order n\geq 3 and girth g(G^{\sigma}).
Then for any real eigenvalue \lambda,

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)\leq n-g(G^{\sigma})+2, |  |

and equality holds if and only if

1. (i)

   G^{\sigma} is a balanced complete signed graph K\_{n}^{\sigma} with \lambda=-1;
2. (ii)

   G^{\sigma} is an antibalanced complete signed graph K\_{n}^{\sigma} with \lambda=1;
3. (iii)
