Unbalanced cycle.
From Lemma 6(ii),

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{j}=2\cos\bigl{(}(2j+1)\pi/n\bigr{)}. |  |

Again, \lambda\_{j}=\lambda\_{n-1-j}, so multiplicity one occurs exactly when

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | j=n-1-j\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad 2j=n-1, |  |

which requires n odd.
The corresponding eigenvalue is

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda=2\cos(\pi)=-2. |  |

Combining the two cases yields the three families listed in the statement.
