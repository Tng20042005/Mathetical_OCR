In this section we recall fundamental concepts and results from spectral graph theory and the theory of signed graphs that will be used throughout the paper. We begin with basic notions of signed cycles, balance, and switching equivalence.

Signed cycles and balance.
Let C^{\sigma} be a signed cycle. Its *signature* (or sign) is defined as the product of the signs of its edges:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \operatorname{sgn}(C^{\sigma})=\prod\_{e\in E(C^{\sigma})}\sigma(e). |  |

A cycle is called *balanced* if \operatorname{sgn}(C^{\sigma})=+1 and *unbalanced* otherwise.
A signed graph G^{\sigma} is *balanced* if every cycle in G^{\sigma} is balanced; otherwise it is *unbalanced*.
A signed graph is *antibalanced* if every even cycle is positive and every odd cycle is negative.

Switching equivalence.
Given a signed graph G^{\sigma}=(G,\sigma) and a *switching function* \zeta:V\to\{\pm 1\}, the signed graph G^{\sigma^{\zeta}}=(G,\sigma^{\zeta}) is obtained by switching at the vertices according to

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \sigma^{\zeta}(uv)=\zeta(u)\,\sigma(uv)\,\zeta(v). |  |

Switching preserves the sign of every cycle, and two signed graphs G^{\sigma\_{1}} and G^{\sigma\_{2}} on the same underlying graph are *switching equivalent*, written G^{\sigma\_{1}}\sim G^{\sigma\_{2}}, if one can be obtained from the other via switching at a set of vertices.
Switching equivalence plays a role analogous to isomorphism for simple graphs. An illustration of switching equivalent graphs is shown in Figure 1.

Adjacency matrix of a signed graph.
For a signed graph G^{\sigma} of order n, the adjacency matrix A(G^{\sigma})=[a^{\sigma}\_{ij}] is defined by

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | a^{\sigma}\_{ij}=\begin{cases}\sigma(v\_{i}v\_{j}),&\text{if }v\_{i}\sim v\_{j},\\[% 4.0pt] 0,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases} |  |

Thus the sign pattern of G^{\sigma} is encoded directly in the entries of A(G^{\sigma}).
Since A(G^{\sigma}) is real and symmetric, all eigenvalues are real and may be ordered as

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | \lambda\_{1}\geq\lambda\_{2}\geq\cdots\geq\lambda\_{n}. |  |

The adjacency spectrum of G^{\sigma}, denoted \mathrm{Spec}\_{A}(G,\sigma), is the multiset of eigenvalues of A(G^{\sigma}) counted with algebraic multiplicity.
For an eigenvalue \lambda, its multiplicity is denoted m(G^{\sigma},\lambda).
Because A(G^{\sigma}) is diagonalizable, the algebraic and geometric multiplicities coincide.
The rank of a signed graph is \operatorname{rank}(G^{\sigma})=\operatorname{rank}(A(G^{\sigma})), and for any eigenvalue \lambda\in\mathbb{R},

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | m(G^{\sigma},\lambda)=n-\operatorname{rank}(\lambda I-A(G^{\sigma})). |  |

Balance via switching.
A classical result of Harary, restated by Zaslavsky in [16], characterizes balance in terms of switching:

###### Lemma 1.

Let G^{\sigma}=(G,\sigma) be a signed graph.
Then G^{\sigma} is balanced if and only if (G,\sigma)\sim(G,+), where (G,+) is the all-positive signing of G.
